I know it&#8217;s been quite some time since I did my [last review](http://blog.thecapacity.org/category/books/).Â  It&#8217;s not that I haven&#8217;t been reading, quite the opposite in fact. My wife and I have been enjoying access to a great library system. I told a friend that going online and requesting holds was like [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Starship-Troopers-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0441783589/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238605211&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20) only I had go to pick them up, a relatively short drive, rather then having them delivered.

I think the reason is that I either read too fast, and move on to the next book too quickly to write a review. Or if I&#8217;m in one of my slogging phases (whether I&#8217;m busy with other things or reading a difficult book) where it just drags out too long to complete.

I&#8217;ll of course try to be better but I&#8217;d rather have a gap in my reviews and still be reading then the alternative.

So why this book, why now? Well I won&#8217;t get into the reasons that I decided to read [Starship Troopers](http://www.amazon.com/Starship-Troopers-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0441783589/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238605211&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20). I&#8217;ve read a few Heinlein books before and the way in which he uses &#8220;language&#8221; as a scientific concept is really interesting. However, my only exposure to this book is from [the movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/), and while I knew they made a [second](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367093/) and [third](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844760/) movie, I didn&#8217;t expect the [volume](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190198/) of such film would reflect highly on the quality of the novel itself.

Let me assure you, this is still every bit the quick read you&#8217;d expect it would be. I finished it with just a few nights of effort. However, what I really enjoyed is that it&#8217;s much more like one of those thrash out &#8220;dialogues&#8221; you&#8217;d have in a class like &#8220;Religion and Moral Philosophy&#8221; then some sort of bug zapping hack and smash.

My minor in college allowed me to take a lot of philosophy classes, and I wouldn&#8217;t claim to be great at such abstract thinking (it&#8217;s really the act of conveying a thought that I find most difficult) but I do love the introspection and the insights you can gain from a good teacher. I happen to have had one at a Summer Scholar&#8217;s session I attended and this book brought me back to those sessions.

I think the movie does a good job of conveying the content, though the campy nature of the movie, which I enjoyed, seems opposite of the book&#8217;s flow. If you&#8217;re looking for an entertaining story which will take you back to the debating days of school then this is the one.
