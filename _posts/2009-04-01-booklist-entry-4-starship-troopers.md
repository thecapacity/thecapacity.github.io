I know it’s been quite some time since I did my [last review](http://blog.thecapacity.org/category/books/).  It’s not that I haven’t been reading, quite the opposite in fact. My wife and I have been enjoying access to a great library system. I told a friend that going online and requesting holds was like [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Starship-Troopers-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0441783589/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238605211&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20) only I had go to pick them up, a relatively short drive, rather then having them delivered.

I think the reason is that I either read too fast, and move on to the next book too quickly to write a review. Or if I’m in one of my slogging phases (whether I’m busy with other things or reading a difficult book) where it just drags out too long to complete.

I’ll of course try to be better but I’d rather have a gap in my reviews and still be reading then the alternative.

So why this book, why now? Well I won’t get into the reasons that I decided to read [Starship Troopers](http://www.amazon.com/Starship-Troopers-Robert-Heinlein/dp/0441783589/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1238605211&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20). I’ve read a few Heinlein books before and the way in which he uses “language” as a scientific concept is really interesting. However, my only exposure to this book is from [the movie](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120201/), and while I knew they made a [second](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0367093/) and [third](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0844760/) movie, I didn’t expect the [volume](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0190198/) of such film would reflect highly on the quality of the novel itself.

Let me assure you, this is still every bit the quick read you’d expect it would be. I finished it with just a few nights of effort. However, what I really enjoyed is that it’s much more like one of those thrash out “dialogues” you’d have in a class like “Religion and Moral Philosophy” then some sort of bug zapping hack and smash.

My minor in college allowed me to take a lot of philosophy classes, and I wouldn’t claim to be great at such abstract thinking (it’s really the act of conveying a thought that I find most difficult) but I do love the introspection and the insights you can gain from a good teacher. I happen to have had one at a Summer Scholar’s session I attended and this book brought me back to those sessions.

I think the movie does a good job of conveying the content, though the campy nature of the movie, which I enjoyed, seems opposite of the book’s flow. If you’re looking for an entertaining story which will take you back to the debating days of school then this is the one.
