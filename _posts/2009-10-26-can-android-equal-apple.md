Here’s an idea for any aspiring hacker out there.

**Find a way to make Android mimic an iPhone when it’s connected.**

Users will gain the ability to use iTunes to sync music and podcasts (and possibly Apple Apps too if the emulation went that far).

However, more important then just leveraging a known user interface it provides an obvious migration path off of Apple’s proprietary lock-in platform.
