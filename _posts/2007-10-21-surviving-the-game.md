Is [this](http://scobleizer.com/2007/10/21/reverse-engineering-techmeme/ "Scoble and Techmeme") really what it’s all come down to? Do you really have to game the system to be heard?

It’s kind of demoralizing. I want to believe it’s possible to be true to oneself and still be successful. However with it seems nearly everyone spends every moment of their intellectual life figuring out how to drown out “the other guy”.

I suppose they’re being true to themselves, where as my “true-ness” says that I should get outside and watch some Lacross, work on making a garage door, help cook, play with my dog, read a book.. etc… not spend hours (even minutes) trying to game TechMeme.

How do people with a balance in their lives do it?
