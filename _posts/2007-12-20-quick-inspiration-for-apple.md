Just a quick post before the holidays, I&#8217;ll be traveling quite a bit so we&#8217;ll see how everything holds up.

**While planning out this trip, I was thinking about making a &#8220;My Maps&#8221; Google map. I tried this technique [while I was in Philadelphia](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2007/11/21/step-by-step/ "Step by Step") but unfortunately it wasn&#8217;t successful.**

**While the iPhone&#8217;s built in map application is awesome it doesn&#8217;t allow you to do the &#8220;My Maps&#8221; things like add your own markers.** At the time I thought &#8220;no big deal&#8221; and fired up the embedded Safari. When the interface didn&#8217;t do what I wanted, I eventually made the map on a PC and then browsed to that map on my iPhone.

**The ultimate problem is that the iPhone won&#8217;t let you scroll the google map**. Because of the multi-touch interface of the iPhone, whenever you make a &#8220;mouse flick&#8221; it tries to scroll the page in the viewport window, not pass that motion down to Google Maps.

This actually happens in a few other web applications as well, but Google maps is the biggest place where I suffer. **I came up with a simple fix last night which would add an approprite key combination to let you do this.**

**I recently stumbled across &#8220;[Petitinvention](http://petitinvention.wordpress.com "Petitinvention")&#8221; and have been jealous of Mac Funamizu&#8217;s ability to articulate ideas in such a visually simplistic and artful manner.**

Subconsciously I must have been influenced by his resent &#8220;[iPhone & iPod Touchs instant access button (you can allocatefunctions)&#8221;](http://petitinvention.wordpress.com/2007/12/20/iphone-ipod-touchs-instant-access-button-you-can-allocate-functions/) concept and it peculated through my brain to last night.

My belief is that the default behavior of the iPhone should stay just as it is. However a useful addition would be that **if you hold down the &#8220;home&#8221; button while making a mouse &#8220;flick&#8221; the iPhone should pass that motion down to the web application instead of interpreting it for itself.**

Hopefully that made sense, otherwise Funamizu-san will have to give me a lot of graphics lessons.

**Happy Holidays to you all!**
