Just a quick post before the holidays, I’ll be traveling quite a bit so we’ll see how everything holds up.

**While planning out this trip, I was thinking about making a “My Maps” Google map. I tried this technique [while I was in Philadelphia](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2007/11/21/step-by-step/ "Step by Step") but unfortunately it wasn’t successful.**

**While the iPhone’s built in map application is awesome it doesn’t allow you to do the “My Maps” things like add your own markers.** At the time I thought “no big deal” and fired up the embedded Safari. When the interface didn’t do what I wanted, I eventually made the map on a PC and then browsed to that map on my iPhone.

**The ultimate problem is that the iPhone won’t let you scroll the google map**. Because of the multi-touch interface of the iPhone, whenever you make a “mouse flick” it tries to scroll the page in the viewport window, not pass that motion down to Google Maps.

This actually happens in a few other web applications as well, but Google maps is the biggest place where I suffer. **I came up with a simple fix last night which would add an approprite key combination to let you do this.**

**I recently stumbled across “[Petitinvention](http://petitinvention.wordpress.com "Petitinvention")” and have been jealous of Mac Funamizu’s ability to articulate ideas in such a visually simplistic and artful manner.**

Subconsciously I must have been influenced by his resent “[iPhone & iPod Touchs instant access button (you can allocatefunctions)”](http://petitinvention.wordpress.com/2007/12/20/iphone-ipod-touchs-instant-access-button-you-can-allocate-functions/) concept and it peculated through my brain to last night.

My belief is that the default behavior of the iPhone should stay just as it is. However a useful addition would be that **if you hold down the “home” button while making a mouse “flick” the iPhone should pass that motion down to the web application instead of interpreting it for itself.**

Hopefully that made sense, otherwise Funamizu-san will have to give me a lot of graphics lessons.

**Happy Holidays to you all!**
