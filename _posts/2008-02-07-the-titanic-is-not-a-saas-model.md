I used to to have many great discussions with a coworker, Dan. I think (hope) _we both learned a lot from each other, because even though we have similar &#8220;technical philosophies&#8221; we approached problems differently_, akin to the [&#8220;Generalist vs Specialist&#8221; debates](http://communicationnation.blogspot.com/2007/08/specialist-or-generalist.html "Generalist vs Specialist").

Though Dan and I don&#8217;t get to have face to face discussions anymore, we still frequently trade links and thanks to technology it doesn&#8217;t seem too hard to continue the development of our insights.

He recently sent me an article about [architecting defensive SaaS deployments](http://www.saasblogs.com/2008/02/07/defensively-architecting-a-saas-implementation/ "Defensive SaaS") , which is something we&#8217;ve talked a lot about in the past. _The article proposes a good analogy but I think makes a mistake in equating SaaS architectures as the &#8220;extreme&#8221; end of that analogy, i.e. large cruise ships._

In my experience, large heavily-defensive deployments are more analogous to a mainframe environments. _[Sinclair](http://www.saasblogs.com/author/sinclair/ "Sinclair Schuller") seems to overlook this larger extreme and only contrast SaaS with a localized service model._

_In my experience although SaaS lies somewhere in between a truly distributed model and a truly centralized model it&#8217;s not really fulfilling this role in the same ways, i.e. it&#8217;s not a differently sized ship._

_SaaS architectures are more like getting around Europe. You&#8217;ve got planes, trains, automobiles and yes, even boats. Each transport has it&#8217;s own qualities of service, it&#8217;s own pros and cons._

_It&#8217;s not a defensive posture that makes SaaS successful but rather the flexibility in choice._
