I used to to have many great discussions with a coworker, Dan. I think (hope) _we both learned a lot from each other, because even though we have similar “technical philosophies” we approached problems differently_, akin to the [“Generalist vs Specialist” debates](http://communicationnation.blogspot.com/2007/08/specialist-or-generalist.html "Generalist vs Specialist").

Though Dan and I don’t get to have face to face discussions anymore, we still frequently trade links and thanks to technology it doesn’t seem too hard to continue the development of our insights.

He recently sent me an article about [architecting defensive SaaS deployments](http://www.saasblogs.com/2008/02/07/defensively-architecting-a-saas-implementation/ "Defensive SaaS") , which is something we’ve talked a lot about in the past. _The article proposes a good analogy but I think makes a mistake in equating SaaS architectures as the “extreme” end of that analogy, i.e. large cruise ships._

In my experience, large heavily-defensive deployments are more analogous to a mainframe environments. _[Sinclair](http://www.saasblogs.com/author/sinclair/ "Sinclair Schuller") seems to overlook this larger extreme and only contrast SaaS with a localized service model._

_In my experience although SaaS lies somewhere in between a truly distributed model and a truly centralized model it’s not really fulfilling this role in the same ways, i.e. it’s not a differently sized ship._

_SaaS architectures are more like getting around Europe. You’ve got planes, trains, automobiles and yes, even boats. Each transport has it’s own qualities of service, it’s own pros and cons._

_It’s not a defensive posture that makes SaaS successful but rather the flexibility in choice._
