I&#8217;m finally getting &#8220;settled&#8221; in my new role working from home and part of that means getting a chance to get through some podcasts. Actually, although I love [TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/talks), I&#8217;m not actually a big fan of podcasts.

Imagine taking all the rambling and inherent pauses of conversation and couple those with ear piercing music, relative to the volume of human speech. Now add in sickeningly upbeat scores, which last too long but are too hard to fast forward through. Then sandwich content between mirrored intros and fade-outs so that back-to-back episodes sometimes yield 2-4 minutes (end of one and the intro of another) of worthless music&#8230;

Well, **it shouldn&#8217;t be hard to see why a constantly information starved individual like myself would have a hard time listening**. It&#8217;s almost a shame because some, like &#8220;[Managerial Tools](http://www.learnoutloud.com/Podcast-Directory/Business/Leadership-and-Management/Manager-Tools-Podcast/19447)&#8220;, have great content **but feel like a waste of time,** when the &#8220;nuggets&#8221; can be gleaned much faster by reading articles.

**However, I do have a soft spot in my soul for two true podcasts&#8230;** I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the [I&#8217;m finally getting &#8220;settled&#8221; in my new role working from home and part of that means getting a chance to get through some podcasts.

**However, I do have a soft spot in my soul for two true podcasts&#8230;** I&#8217;ve really enjoyed the](http://edcorner.stanford.edu/podcasts.html) sessions due to their diverse treatment of all things &#8220;innovative&#8221; and &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; and the [NotHans Podcast](http://www.nothans.com/podcast/) (which I really think should be called a &#8220;NotCast&#8221;) because of its quick humor and varying overt and subtle shades of joviality. **I&#8217;d recommend both many times over for people who like those sorts of things.**

However, **I am rapidly gaining another favorite on my list** which is the &#8220;[Harvard Business IdeaCast](http://hbsp.libsyn.com/rss)&#8220;. I&#8217;ve worked my way through eight episodes, so I&#8217;m still withholding judgment, and today **in [Episode 95](http://traffic.libsyn.com/hbsp/HB_IdeaCast_Episode_95-Gen_X_Future.m4a), I found even more gold.**

In this episode, or the accompanying [Business Week article](http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/may2008/ca20080515_250308.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_news+%2B+analysis), **[Tammy Erickson](http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/erickson/) tackles one of the biggest challenges facing corporations in the next 10 years, one I [wrote about](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2008/06/24/you-must-be-38-or-younger-to-view-this-post/) recently.**

**We&#8217;ve heard of [developing future leaders](http://traffic.libsyn.com/hbsp/HBR_IdeaCast_Episode_93-Where_Find_Tomorrows_Leaders.m4a), from Professor Linda A. Hill, but Tammy makes us aware that the roles being &#8220;prepared&#8221; may not align with the ones being desired by those leaders.**

She writes about it in [Top 10 Talent-Management Challenges](http://discussionleader.hbsp.com/erickson/2008/06/todays_top_ten_talent_manageme.html) and I hope there are a lot of people reading and acting on her insights. From the dangers of [&#8220;extreme jobs&#8221;](http://traffic.libsyn.com/hbsp/HBR_IdeaCast_21.m4a) beginning to normalize our performance expectations and **we&#8217;re in danger of forming a corporate environment that Gen-Yers (and some Gen-Xers) simply don&#8217;t want to join.**
