One of the ‘trends’ in programming is [Monkey Patching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) which bypasses fixed static types and is used in more dynamic languages. I internalize the technique as; “if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck…. then who cares what it really is”.

Yea, as a philosophy I know it lacks nuance but it’s worked well historically so let that dog hunt.

Another important bit of geek-trivia is the famous [Turing Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), if you’re here and don’t know what that is (or how to figure it out) then you should move along now, this isn’t the droid you’re looking for.

Simplified, Turing’s Test and Monkey Patching both suggest that explicit identifications aren’t practical. Rather that implicit behaviors should define the use of something. It’s a very expedient supposition that anyone who’s dealt with contracts would envy.

**What’s in this for Cloud, given that NIST has done a nice job of [defining](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/cloud-computing/) cloud in practical terms?**

As a buzzword, cloud’s seen more then it’s fair share of hype;

So everyone’s been trying to claim the moniker, and today I was reading about a ‘cloud based product’ that really was simply a web portal much like [Walmart](walmart.com). Though I’m sure it can accurately claim to be cloud under a number of definitions, my instinct was “No, definitely not”.

However, a colleague replied to my skepticism saying; “it underlines that there are already commonplace applications in use that are legitimately ‘cloud’.”

**Where do you stand on such a claim?** _That online shopping or market makers such as [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/) are SaaS cloud services?_

Underlying it all, are deep philosophical questions as integral to humanity’s future as determining where the soul resides!

  * **What if I have an amazingly dynamic and responsive application, run by monkeys behind the curtain?**
  * **Would I be cloud computing if I used twitter via snail mail?**
  * **Does my subdivision’s swimming pool classify as IaaS**, with its broad network-wide (i.e. roads) access, and rapid elasticity (easy capacity management) and measured service (towel charge) if there’s no lifeguard (On-demand self-service)? ****Surely you don’t need me to explain “resource pooling”.

**Strictly speaking I’m not sure where I stand, but I think Turing would tell me to go with the duck and even a million monkeys patching the pool shouldn’t change my mind.**
