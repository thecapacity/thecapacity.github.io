One of the &#8216;trends&#8217; in programming is [Monkey Patching](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch) which bypasses fixed static types and is used in more dynamic languages. I internalize the technique as; &#8220;if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks like a duck&#8230;. then who cares what it really is&#8221;.

Yea, as a philosophy I know it lacks nuance but it&#8217;s worked well historically so let that dog hunt.

Another important bit of geek-trivia is the famous [Turing Test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test), if you&#8217;re here and don&#8217;t know what that is (or how to figure it out) then you should move along now, this isn&#8217;t the droid you&#8217;re looking for.

Simplified, Turing&#8217;s Test and Monkey Patching both suggest that explicit identifications aren&#8217;t practical. Rather that implicit behaviors should define the use of something. It&#8217;s a very expedient supposition that anyone who&#8217;s dealt with contracts would envy.

**What&#8217;s in this for Cloud, given that NIST has done a nice job of [defining](http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SNS/cloud-computing/) cloud in practical terms?**

As a buzzword, cloud&#8217;s seen more then it&#8217;s fair share of hype;

So everyone&#8217;s been trying to claim the moniker, and today I was reading about a &#8216;cloud based product&#8217; that really was simply a web portal much like [Walmart](walmart.com). Though I&#8217;m sure it can accurately claim to be cloud under a number of definitions, my instinct was &#8220;No, definitely not&#8221;.

However, a colleague replied to my skepticism saying; &#8220;it underlines that there are already commonplace applications in use that are legitimately &#8216;cloud&#8217;.&#8221;

**Where do you stand on such a claim?** _That online shopping or market makers such as [eBay](http://www.ebay.com/) are SaaS cloud services?_

Underlying it all, are deep philosophical questions as integral to humanity&#8217;s future as determining where the soul resides!

  * **What if I have an amazingly dynamic and responsive application, run by monkeys behind the curtain?**
  * **Would I be cloud computing if I used twitter via snail mail?**
  * **Does my subdivision&#8217;s swimming pool classify as IaaS**, with its broad network-wide (i.e. roads) access, and rapid elasticity (easy capacity management) and measured service (towel charge) if there&#8217;s no lifeguard (On-demand self-service)? ****Surely you don&#8217;t need me to explain &#8220;resource pooling&#8221;.

**Strictly speaking I&#8217;m not sure where I stand, but I think Turing would tell me to go with the duck and even a million monkeys patching the pool shouldn&#8217;t change my mind.**
