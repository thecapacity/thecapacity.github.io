I was reading Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/10/web_30_semantic_web_web_20.html" title="What is Web 3.0" target="_blank">post</a> and wanted to record my initial impressions. Tim is a very persuasive writer, not simply because of his pedigree or his prose, but because of the process by which he allows the reader to realize the substance behind what he&#8217;s saying.

In short, he doesn&#8217;t seek to bludgeon, berate or bribe the reader into believing. He simply illustrates the facts and lets the reader reach for personal conclusions.

Personally, what do I think Web 3.0 is? I&#8217;m not as qualified to judge as some since I&#8217;m only just now participating. However, I&#8217;ve always been a &#8220;lurker&#8221; or in less negative terms a &#8220;watcher&#8221;. I follow things, a great many things, all at once, e.g. Linux, Enterprise Architectures, Web 2.0, Programming Paradigms, Design and Art, Gadgets and Gizmos.

Through these things and others, the commonality I enjoy watching is the social change that results.

Web 0.x &#8211; 1.0 seemed mostly about **content**. People were excited they could share information and so they started to put anything out there. In Web 1.x &#8211; 2.0 a lot of effort has been around **accessibility** i.e. sorting the mess to find relevant information. Activities such as; Search, Microformats, Semantic-ness, Mashups, even the [recent Security Standards](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/oauth_one.php "OAuth News") all center around this aspect of making data accessible in ways which are intuitive and relevant to a user (whether human or not).

It shouldn&#8217;t be hard to establish an axiom that because humans are social creatures, any change results in social change. Consider the corroborating evidence that the &#8220;change&#8221; web 2.0 brought us was social networks, Q.E.D.

Can effect lead us to cause? Reconsider the 3.0 question in reverse; **What social change will Web 3.0 bring ?**

I believe the foundational change Web 3.0 will bring is **decentralization**, in the ability of disparate components to integrate seamlessly.

We&#8217;re starting to see it now with &#8220;mashups&#8221;, but in Web 3.0 **the level of decentralization will produce integration at an unprecedented level !** Note the level of integration Apple seeks to achieve with its family of products, and resultant shift we&#8217;ve seen in their business model. Or the rise of openstandards and opensource.

I believe Web 3.0 will not be a technology change, but rather **a participatory shift.**

  <strong>Web 3.0 is social change. Change brought about as technologies are integrated into our lives, not just for a select few early adopters, but for a great many. </strong>
