Just a quick post, but I&#8217;m in a meeting and we&#8217;ve spent over an hour discussion how Team A needs information about Team B&#8217;s usage numbers, i.e. how many hours they&#8217;ve worked and for whom.

As an engineer it seems straightforward, but if we have our business glasses on (or sometimes called reality) we learn that Team B is using a tool that&#8217;s going end of life. I also suspect that it&#8217;s a SWAG metric that Team B&#8217;s been using for an order of magnitude estimate and they know that Team A is going to be using it as gospel!

So that seems like enough ambiguity with maybe 20-30 minutes of circular discussions, but because of the vacuity what happens is that we enter a downward spiral of &#8220;what if&#8221;, &#8220;why&#8221;, &#8220;why not&#8221;, &#8220;what are we going to do&#8221;, &#8220;who should do what&#8221; and this is multiplied many times over by multiple people inserting their own viewpoint of a facet.

Take a breath, take a break and take note;

**If you don&#8217;t have a hard answer for something then <u>write it down!</u> Make a note to tell people you&#8217;ll investigate it and get back to them.**

**The most important thing you can do is** **Move On!**

**[Don&#8217;t loose the battle of progress because of a single nail!](http://www.rhymes.org.uk/for_want_of_a_nail.htm "For want of a nail...")**

PS. I&#8217;m also sure I could use this experience to make a great case on how continuous partial attention enforces a marginalized standard of excellence. Of course I could also point out that at least I got a blog post written!
