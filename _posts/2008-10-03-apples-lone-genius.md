[Cool visualizations aside](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dx_ZO-3e80tY%26feature%3Drelated&ei=hGbmSJGnDaO8gQTRnMiBCw&usg=AFQjCNHEFNExoKfvjjE6hXPXPPECM_T_UA&sig2=xuIZsclhExtGJvV-8KHOfQ), **the most interesting announcement of iTunes 8 (and the quick subsequent bugfix) was the new &#8220;[Genius](http://www.apple.com/itunes/whatsnew/)&#8221; feature.**

**Steve Jobs has been [criticized](http://petersmagnusson.com/2007/07/01/iphones-missing-killer-app-social-networking/) for being out of touch before, when the iPhone came out with out any sort of social networking.** I vouch that the much vaunted Apple &#8220;experience&#8221; breaks down at the usage fringes, i.e. if you&#8217;re not using it to listen to your extensive music collection it&#8217;s pretty rough around the edges.

**What Genius does is mix and match music** based on beats and other metrics and builds playlists. I listen to podcasts and audiobooks so I can&#8217;t speak from real experience but [word is](http://twitter.com/fjania/statuses/938227159) that it&#8217;s neat and amazingly successful.

However, even after all the successes of &#8220;social networking&#8221;, **Genius really seems to highlight Apple&#8217;s interesting lack of desire to build collaboration in their products.**

**I find it shocking that there&#8217;s absolutely no &#8220;social networking&#8221; features like Last.fm.** It seems Apple thinks math can be a better friend to you then your own friends (like that time when they [rickrolled](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRickrolling&ei=HGnmSI2FFpOehgTb--CECw&usg=AFQjCNGN_tC0JjE4zrfjQLyzpk6jmalOPQ&sig2=e8lJPWTycLEOj5eSM_nvsQ) you).

As often as I send links to friends with delicious, or videos on YouTube, **you&#8217;d think a day had come with you could nudge your friends to try out this song**&#8230; well of course Zune tried that but failed.

However, one believes Apple could &#8220;do it right&#8221; and **the fact that they haven&#8217;t even tried seems suspicious.** It seems that until they do, whether it&#8217;s from &#8220;Top 40&#8221; count downs or inhuman algorithms, we&#8217;ll forever be forced to take &#8220;the man&#8217;s&#8221; word for what&#8217;s cool.
