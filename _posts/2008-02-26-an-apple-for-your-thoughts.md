_Am I the only one who wonders why Apple has to take their store offline every time the release a new product?_

It doesn&#8217;t seem beyond Apple&#8217;s ability to &#8220;flip a switch&#8221; to make things instantly live.

For a company as secretive about product announcements, you could say they do it to ensure a higher level of secrecy, but _I have to imagine they do it for the marketing buzz_.
