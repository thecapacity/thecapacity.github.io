Monk at work has [another great post](http://monkatwork.com/2007/11/05/productivity-is-a-full-body-exercise/ "Train for life") about the CrossFit motto; General Physical Preparedness. It&#8217;s a style of physical training that Adam relates to work, and continual improvement. Something he terms &#8220;General Work Preparedness&#8221; with admonishment to &#8220;Generalize, not specialize&#8221; because &#8220;specialization has its price&#8221;.
  
I think it&#8217;s similar to a discussion I had with a college of mine regarding the difference between [&#8220;specialists&#8221; and &#8220;generalists&#8221;](http://creativegeneralist.blogspot.com/2007/08/specialists-and-generalists-in-3d.html "Specialists vs Generalists"). Even though I&#8217;m not a fan of the terms, when I saw the graphic it was actually inspiring to me.

In my work we have &#8220;IT Architects&#8221; and &#8220;IT Specialists&#8221; and it&#8217;s tempting to equate Architect to Generalist and draw a similar connection for Specialist. However, I think that&#8217;s more a fallacy enforced by English rather then a realistic comparison.

It seems entirely realistic to be that there might be someone who specializes in Linux but who can architect a complex multi-platform solution. Or if that seems too contrived consider an architect who&#8217;s entire world has been the mainframe.

**A better conclusion from this discussion, but by no means the end of the discussion, would be to consider the different approaches that a Generalist and Specialist bring toward problem solving, and not the specific subject matter depth.** 

When you talk with a colleague do they speak in &#8220;high level&#8221; abstract concepts, or do they attempt to convey vagaries with with tangible, though perhaps not entirely accurate, examples. **I believe a generalist approach tends to paint in broad brush strokes, where as specialists attempt to make things more tangible.**

We all have strengths and affinities but as Adam says, &#8220;specialization&#8221; (in this case too much of one approach) has a price. I read somewhere today that successful entrepreneurs are individuals who can be both creative (sales, marketing, innovation, design&#8230;) and disciplined (operations, finance, paying bills, &#8230;).

Maybe one of those behaviors comes more readily then the other and maybe you don&#8217;t aspire to run your own business, but you must still represent this personal growth in your career.

So what are you training for in your career? Currently in my life I can design, implement and manage IT Infrastructure. **Just like with GPP I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll need those skills for but if I need them at least I know I won&#8217;t throw out my back.**
