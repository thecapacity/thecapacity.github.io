I was &#8216;talking&#8217; with a friend of mine and she expressed concern over what the future will hold when the majority of social interaction is via the Internet vs. face-to-face. [Social Networking](http://www.google.com/trends?q=social+networking "Google Trends - 'social networking'") has nearly reached mainstream acceptance and it&#8217;s proven to be a powerful tool for cultivating relationships, both pre-existing as well as ones which might have otherwise fizzled.

**She worried that people with 400 &#8216;friends&#8217; placed less emphases on &#8216;friendship&#8217;** then those of us who are a little less popular, or at least less eager to claim a connection. I understand her concerns but felt some irony since we were communicating over &#8216;instant messanger&#8217; at the time.

I wondered if she was projecting her experiences a little too strongly and believe that [it may not be all that serious](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/06/opinion/06mathias.html/partner/rssnyt/?_r=1&oref=slogin "The Facebook Generation"). I&#8217;ve met people on the internet and known them for months before seeing them IRL &#8211; in real life. In fact, I have a good friend who met his wife online. So **I know it&#8217;s possible to cultivate lasting relationships even if you can&#8217;t meet for drinks or talk over coffee**. If humans can personify plants then it&#8217;s not surprising to me that we can respond to strongly even to just graphical representations of people.

I was reminded of this when reading [_Reversing Cause and Effect_](http://www.chicagobeta.com/reversing-cause-and-effect/ "Reversing Cause and Effect") by Keith Schacht. **Keith explains that many people expect to become &#8216;friends&#8217; and then try to leverage the network, regardless of the strength of the connection.**

I love Keith&#8217;s ability to summarize the distinction, but I wonder it&#8217;s also a case of someone inflicting the experiences of the past on the present and future. I think in Keith&#8217;s exampe, he simply felt put out by the woman but **I believe there&#8217;s two sides to consider**;

  1. If I were Keith&#8217;s true friend, with the job opening, I&#8217;d want him to pass on the contact to me, along with his impressions. Far better to have some basis for judging this application (even a negative impression) then to let that valuable data go to waste and be forced to consider it in the absence of valuable input from your network.
  2. It&#8217;s also possible that the woman wasn&#8217;t entirely in wrong either, though clearly she went about it awkwardly. After all, she had made a connection with Keith, and her exploring the value of that link is exactly the act of &#8220;offering value&#8221; that Keith agrees must be practiced to build true friendship.

LinkedIn actually leverages the introduction concept. I believe the woman&#8217;s mistake was in confusing a recommendation (what she asked for) with a referral (the most she should have expect).

Social networks are bringing a level of &#8216;intimacy&#8217; to a scale most of us are unused to experiencing. However, as Giff Constable [remarks](http://blogs.electricsheepcompany.com/giff/?p=474 "The 95% club") **there&#8217;s a lot of power in being able to extend a &#8216;friendship&#8217; to someone you would have lost touch with previously.**

**Clearly, just as IRL, some of those &#8216;friends&#8217; will have [more tact](http://www.businessweek.com/managing/content/oct2007/ca2007109_711568.htm?campaign_id=rss_daily "10 Tips for Networkers") then others.**
