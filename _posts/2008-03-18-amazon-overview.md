_If you&#8217;ve read my earlier posts you know I spend a bit of time following Amazon_, both from a business perspective as well as my interest in the energy they&#8217;ve invested in webservice (SaaS) technologies.

_I recently gave a presentation to discuss their offerings and wanted to [make that available](http://www.slideshare.net/thecapacity/amazon-ws-overview/ "Amazon WS Overview") to anyone interested._

_I build presentations that can also act as &#8220;guidebooks&#8221; once the discussion is over_, i.e. the presentation interests someone in the topic, but the charts should also be useful as a starting point for their own experience. Thus I&#8217;ve included links and citations for the various sections. _It may seem a little overwhelming when you&#8217;re just paging through but it seems to work well for my presentation style and my typical audience._

I always find it interesting to compare and contrast my experience with a presentation given verbally vs. paging through the deck later. In an engaging conversation, some of the more interesting and thought provoking dialogs revolve around a single bullet point. However, when paging through a deck you&#8217;re often drawn to &#8220;examples&#8221; which are really for a reference or to substantiate a divergent discussion.

_I&#8217;m most interested in the &#8220;implications and extrapolation&#8221; phase of a presentation as opposed to ones that review the &#8220;what and why&#8221; of an activity._

_I hope you&#8217;ll find this interesting and helpful and if there&#8217;s any parts I can help elaborate on please let me know._
