As the year draws to a close, I&#8217;ve been busy trying to complete multiple projects concurrently. However, a few months ago I purchased an iPhone and it&#8217;s proven to be very effective at productively filling the &#8220;in between&#8221; time.

I only owned an nano previously and never used it for much beyond the gym. However, with the iPhone I have been able to watch many interesting presentations such as the [Google Tech Talks](http://research.google.com/video.html) or listen to [Standard lectures on iTunes](http://itunes.stanford.edu/).

Two of the more interesting sessions have been [Dan Pritchett on the Architecture at eBay](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/dan-pritchett-ebay-architecture) and [<font size="-1"><span id="wholedescr" class="visible">Cuong Do<br /> Cuong on the amazing s</span></font>calability efforts of <font size="-1"><span id="wholedescr" class="visible"></span></font>YouTube](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6304964351441328559).

In the mornings, I wake up early and read web articles at home before work. Yesterday, I stumbled across [the blog of Nati Shalom](http://natishalom.typepad.com/nati_shaloms_blog/2007/11/architecture-yo.html) of [GigaSpaces](http://www.gigaspaces.com/), in particular [his summary of the Qcon conference](http://natishalom.typepad.com/nati_shaloms_blog/2007/11/architecture-yo.html). I had never heard of Qcon before but a [quick](http://qcon.infoq.com/london-2007/conference/) [look](http://qcon.infoq.com/sanfrancisco/conference/) reveals a track list like an enterprise [CV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curriculum_vitae).

  * **Architecture Quality &#8211;** Modifiability, Product Lines, Latency, Performance and Scalability, Architecture
  
    Patterns
  * **Banking Architectures** &#8211; Real time, STP, Messaging, AMQP, SEPA, MiFID, Front office
  * **Connecting SOA and the Web: How much REST do we need?** &#8211; REST & SOA, Internet Scale Integration, REST & WS Myths
  * &#8230;

This reminded me of another convention I recently became aware of, [O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s first ever Money:Tech converence.](http://en.oreilly.com/money2008/public/content/about)

I can honestly summarize the work I&#8217;m a part of by saying we make IT infrastructures like these or bigger, happen.

The good news is that I don&#8217;t manage these architectures long term or on a day to day basis. Primarily, I&#8217;m part of a team that designs (pen and paper exercise), builds (install and configure a proof of concept) or tests (benchmark) environments that other businesses will use, and maintain, in their production environments.

Although there are feedback loops, the bad news is I sometimes feel out of sync with reality, and a touch ADD since I&#8217;m moving between architectures and technologies so rapidly. However, the more difficult problem is that I often work twice as hard to make sure a &#8220;thought exercise&#8221;, which someone&#8217;s going to use for their business, will be what is needed even, or perhaps especially, when they&#8217;re not sure what those needs are.

Although my company has plenty of internal conferences, it&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that what I do doesn&#8217;t make the tracks at most of these external conferences. It&#8217;s kind of like the difference between gyms and country clubs, you don&#8217;t hear much about the latter but they&#8217;re out there.

It&#8217;s probably also certain that what I do will never serve you a funny spoof or some video of a cute boy/girl booty dancing, but I work for institutions that house your money or your medical records and it&#8217;s a safe bet that what it lacks in glamor it makes up for in success.

While we&#8217;re not as vocal about what we do as eBay or YouTube, I feel confidant that our clients haven&#8217;t endured the endless cycle of sleepless nights of the YouTube team (watch the video), or suffered the [numerous](http://www.news.com/eBay-outage-a-one-two-punch/2100-1033_3-217457.html) [downtime](http://www.news.com/eBay-online-again-after-14-hour-outage/2100-1017_3-229518.html) [issues](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/20/skype_outage_post-mortem/) for which eBay become known.

Maybe we should make a bigger effort to be present at these conferences, I&#8217;d like to believe I could effect that change. I&#8217;ve learned a lot just by watching the after effects, and I believe sharing with the same community would make us all more successful.
