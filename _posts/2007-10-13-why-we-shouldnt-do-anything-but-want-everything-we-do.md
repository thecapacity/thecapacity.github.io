I’ve been reading [Monk at Work](http://monkatwork.com/ "Monk at Work") and have really enjoyed the honest, unfettered professionalism it brings. Adam merges the sometimes harsh world of management and motivation with what I consider to be a southern “cut to the chase” attitude, all while maintaining a zen-like absence of frustration which I envy him for having.

In _[Are You Feeding Your Inner Rebel Candy, Or Kryptonite](http://monkatwork.com/2007/10/08/rebel/ "Want what's right")_ **Adam’s insight hit close to home**. I have a “never ending todo list”; in my mind if you can’t think of something cool to do, even though you may not have time to do it, then you’re not trying.

However, **my list has many things that I feel I “really should do” which keep getting put off**. I [recently discovered](http://www.kdedevelopers.org/node/2987 "Surprise Features") the concept of an [Eisenhower Matrix](http://ezinearticles.com/?Time-Management---Some-Philosophical-and-Practical-Considerations&id=102414 "Eisenhower Matrix") and although I don’t quite have the same power to delegate **it’s been a powerful tool for me to better prioritize my list.**

Fancy organizational tricks are sometimes another way of reconciling the reality that you’ll never get every task done. However, **Adam’s post speaks to some of the underlying reasons why many things won’t get done**, at least not without a major struggle, whatever the organizational system you use.

**If you can’t make yourself <u>want</u> to accomplish the task, then it will be painful to do even if it <u>should</u> be done.** I think we can all learn this lesson from Adam. It doesn’t mean things suddenly become easy, but if we can find a way to desire completion the rebel won’t interfere.
