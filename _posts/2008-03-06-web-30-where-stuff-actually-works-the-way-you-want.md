I haven&#8217;t waded through all the implications of [Apple&#8217;s event](http://bigtech.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2008/03/06/live-blog-apple-sdk-announcement/?section=money_topstories "Apple Event liveblog") today but _this in particular caught my eye_;

> &#8220;He’s picked up an iPhone. He’s going into contacts, calendar and
  
> e-mail, and it’s all empty. Now he’s looking at settings, goes into
  
> mail settings, and looks at an Exchange account that’s already set up.
  
> He turns on ActiveSync for contacts, mail and everything, and now he
  
> goes in and everything from the server has been pushed down to the
  
> phone.&#8221;

Couple it with Google&#8217;s [announcement](http://googledataapis.blogspot.com/2008/03/3-2-1-contact-api-has-landed.html "Google Contacts API") today that they&#8217;ve opened their Contacts API and I expect that _soon we&#8217;ll see Google contacts syncing with the iPhone_. I&#8217;ve already started standardizing on Google as my &#8220;information backup&#8221; and think this would be great!

One of the [critiques](http://petersmagnusson.com/2007/07/01/iphones-missing-killer-app-social-networking/ "iPhone Critique") on the iPhone was that since Steve loves music, it&#8217;s great for music. However, Steve doesn&#8217;t get &#8220;social applications&#8221; so it&#8217;s lacking in those capacities (e.g. no GPS and &#8220;buddy locator&#8221;). Personally, I&#8217;ve seen how painful iTunes can be syncing video and podcasts, especially when managing multiple phones from one iTunes, so I imagine Steve isn&#8217;t watching too many TED talks or iTunes U!

_I believe linking Facebook & Twitter status with my iPhone would start a killer level of integration. Imaging scrolling through your contacts list to see what they&#8217;re doing._ While we&#8217;re at it, why not fade out those people I don&#8217;t call frequently (or who aren&#8217;t &#8220;socially&#8221; active) as much, i.e. Vinny&#8217;s Pizza joint doesn&#8217;t need to weigh in my attention at the same level as my wife! Why is alphabetical the only visualization option. _If we can get picture flow for music albums, why not for my closest friends!_

Picture being bored and wanting to find someone to connect with and scrolling through your list and knowing; &#8220;Chris is heading to the gym&#8221; &#8230; don&#8217;t call him. &#8220;Kyle is cooking&#8230;&#8221; ok, he&#8217;s out. Then finally seeing &#8220;Peter is watching the rain come down&#8221; &#8230; \*ring ring\*.

_It speaks to the growing level of integration I hope we&#8217;ll start to see from our products._ The O&#8217;Reilly Radar has introduced [software above the level of a single device](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/12/nick-carr-discovers-software-a.html "Software above a single device"), and _this is my interpretation of that reality! I believe Web 3.0 is the social side of all this technology and it sounds like here we come!_
