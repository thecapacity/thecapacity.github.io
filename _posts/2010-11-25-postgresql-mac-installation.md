Just a quick note for Thanksgiving.

I&#8217;m doing some experimentation and thought, given my frustrations with Sun and Oracle that I&#8217;d check out PostgreSQL instead of mysql (my typical DB of choice).

Unfortunately, theÂ <a>Mac installer</a> threw some issues, stating:

> &#8220;The database cluster initialization failed.&#8221;

If you&#8217;re interested you can check out:

> sudo less /tmp/bitrock_installer.log

And at the end you&#8217;ll probably see a failure such as:

> &#8220;su: no directory&#8221;

I tried running the command manually, but got the same error and realized that&#8217;s because I set my user to &#8220;postgres&#8221; but that user doesn&#8217;t exist.

The installer tells you it will create the user, but apparently doesn&#8217;t. So if you run the initcluster.sh script as your normal user (or set the installer to use a user that exists) you should be ok.

Happy Turkey Day and hope that helps someone!!
