Tim O’Reilly’s got another set of good thoughts on [Software Above the Level of a Single Device](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/11/software_above_single_device.html).

I found the title a bit misleading but my simplified summary is that, companies should think beyond a single interface for their product. He uses the example of using a PC for managing an embedded device in a richer manner then the device can allow and also uses iTunes as an example.

I posted some thoughts in his comment section but wanted to recreate them here because it aligns with [my earlier thoughts](http://blog.thecapacity.org/?p=19 "Seemless is Seamless") on “seemless” [sic] integration.

Here’s the content of my reply to Tim;

> Tim,
  
> I think you’re right that product owners need to consider the experience beyond just “their” product, and I definitely agree that the iPhone needs to embrace the address book further. However, I think it’s more then just using the PC to manage an embedded device.
> 
> What I really want is “seemless” [sic] integration.
> 
> In your example, why should I have to use iTunes to update my address book for my iPhone, why not either or and have them synced… they kind of do that now…
> 
> So beyond now, why not use facebook to update my iPhone’s contact list, or vice versa. If a user sets their facebook status to “Jay is busy working” then maybe it might be useful for my phone to show me that status before I tried calling them to talk about the big game lastnight.
> 
> I don’t mind multiple services, twitter, facebook, gmail++ but I do mind having to constantly enter information multiple times, and I think we need to look beyond “export and import” as a solution.
> 
> The true answer is that consumers don’t want to use a PC to manage “this” and that” they want all their things to manage each other!

Do you think it’s possible? Or is that just my personal utopia?
