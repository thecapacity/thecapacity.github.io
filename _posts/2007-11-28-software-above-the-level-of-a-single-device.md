Tim O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s got another set of good thoughts on [Software Above the Level of a Single Device](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/11/software_above_single_device.html).

I found the title a bit misleading but my simplified summary is that, companies should think beyond a single interface for their product. He uses the example of using a PC for managing an embedded device in a richer manner then the device can allow and also uses iTunes as an example.

I posted some thoughts in his comment section but wanted to recreate them here because it aligns with [my earlier thoughts](http://blog.thecapacity.org/?p=19 "Seemless is Seamless") on &#8220;seemless&#8221; [sic] integration.

Here&#8217;s the content of my reply to Tim;

> Tim,
  
> I think you&#8217;re right that product owners need to consider the experience beyond just &#8220;their&#8221; product, and I definitely agree that the iPhone needs to embrace the address book further. However, I think it&#8217;s more then just using the PC to manage an embedded device.

> In your example, why should I have to use iTunes to update my address book for my iPhone, why not either or and have them synced&#8230; they kind of do that now&#8230;
> 
> So beyond now, why not use facebook to update my iPhone&#8217;s contact list, or vice versa. If a user sets their facebook status to &#8220;Jay is busy working&#8221; then maybe it might be useful for my phone to show me that status before I tried calling them to talk about the big game lastnight.

> I don&#8217;t mind multiple services, twitter, facebook, gmail++ but I do mind having to constantly enter information multiple times, and I think we need to look beyond &#8220;export and import&#8221; as a solution.

> The true answer is that consumers don&#8217;t want to use a PC to manage &#8220;this&#8221; and that&#8221; they want all their things to manage each other!

Do you think it&#8217;s possible? Or is that just my personal utopia?
