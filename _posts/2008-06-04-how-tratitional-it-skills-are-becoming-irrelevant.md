I hope those who know me wouldn&#8217;t peg me as an alarmist. So take my title with a grain of salt but also, because of that same optimism, with a sense of sobriety.

I&#8217;ve followed &#8220;cloud computing&#8221; for a while (before it was called that), most often in the context of Amazon. From my position, it&#8217;s been really interesting to see the growth and dead-ends of this shift. And although in some ways it represents an outside disruptive force for my job, in others it&#8217;s a technology and mindset I&#8217;m trying to drive internally and externally.

My analogy for my job is that I help design, edit and publish &#8220;books&#8221; but never write one of my own, so some of my perspectives are gleaned second hand without the heat and intensity of battle. Yet, I&#8217;m also keen to learn from other&#8217;s failures (and successes) so I do my best to leverage the examples others provide.

[SmugMug](http://smugmug.com/) is a photo sharing site that&#8217;s been a big champion (and occasional critic) of Amazon&#8217;s services and despite seeing their use of them as a competitive advantage they&#8217;ve been very open about their practices. Recently they [described](http://blogs.smugmug.com/don/2008/06/03/skynet-lives-aka-ec2-smugmug/) how they&#8217;ve built a very successful workflow around these concepts and I think you should give it a read.

There&#8217;s a tangible shift in computing that I don&#8217;t think has been felt in more traditional environments. Certainly enterprise IT is used to hearing fads fall to the floor, anyone remember &#8220;The Mainframe is dead&#8221;? But it&#8217;s also very easy to point to successful companies like SmugMug and claim they&#8217;re not enterprise players.

However, consider Amazon (or Google) and remember they don&#8217;t just provide this stuff for fun. It&#8217;s what they themselves use internally for their &#8220;day jobs&#8221; and that [it&#8217;s because of these same services](http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/06/01/bezos-talks-web-services/) and not in spite of them, that they&#8217;ve reached their current heights.

Time will only tell if they can hold these lofty positions, but my belief is that the future&#8217;s in the clouds.
