Here&#8217;s a video review I saw on [OpenCulture](http://www.openculture.com/2009/04/talent_10000_hours_luck.html) for two books which I really enjoyed, &#8220;[Outliers](http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239914857&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20)&#8221; and &#8220;[Talent is Overrated](http://www.amazon.com/Talent-Overrated-Separates-World-Class-Performers/dp/1591842247/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239914937&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20)&#8220;.



It&#8217;s a little tongue in cheek, with a bit of profanity, but it made me laugh and remember how much I loved these books.

Both are great, and I wouldn&#8217;t want to have to pick a favorite, though I love [Gladwell&#8217;s](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Malcolm%20Gladwell) ability to make complex concepts and their implications so readable. If this is a topic you&#8217;re interested in then plan on reading them as a pair, in my case I read &#8220;[Outliers](http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239914857&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20)&#8221; second.

Unlike the video&#8217;s humorous conclusion, that we still have the fates to blame, I ascribe to the [Vaynerchuk](http://garyvaynerchuk.com/) believe that it&#8217;s up to you to &#8220;[Crush It](http://rooreynolds.com/2008/10/12/gary-vaynerchuck-and-others-at-the-web-20-expo-ny/)&#8220;. I also think that if you don&#8217;t &#8220;make it&#8221; then it&#8217;s less about fault and more about desire and whether or not that perceived outcome was appropriate.

Regardless of how you percieve Fate, Destiny or Karma I find it inspirational to believe &#8220;[you can do it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rAHnwWfsaY)&#8221; is a creed experts think you can live by, just don&#8217;t stop.
