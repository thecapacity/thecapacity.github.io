No, this has nothing to do with [strange anthropological experiences](http://www.amazon.com/Keep-River-Your-Right-Cannibal/dp/B00006CXH4/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1206014599&sr=8-1) it&#8217;s even more fascinating&#8230;

I watched a great video from iTunes U (my new favorite pastime) and it made two (of many) interesting points;

  1. Wal*Mart, which would be China&#8217;s 8th largest trading partner if it were a country and is the United State&#8217;s largest business, doesn&#8217;t make a single thing. Instead, their success is due to their logistical knowledge and expertise.
  2. UPS doesn&#8217;t just &#8220;deliver things&#8221; they&#8217;re also &#8220;in-sourced&#8221; to perform operations for companies, for example Toshiba. When you mail a laptop out for service, it gets picked up by UPS, taken to one of their facilities, repaired by UPS and mailed back to, all without ever touching Toshiba&#8217;s hands.

_In that many ways the world wide economy is turning into a &#8220;knowledge based economy&#8221;where the ability to conceive of an idea dictates success_, not specifically the ability to build or deploy that idea, those proficiencies can be contracted.

There is certainly value for operational excellence a la Wal*Mart, Starbucks, UPS and _today I think we get to add one more to that list, Amazon._

_They&#8217;ve announced a &#8220;[Fulfillment Web service (FWS)](http://blog.awswebshop.com/2008/03/20/our-most-fulfilling-web-service-yet/ "Amazon Fulfillment Webservice")&#8221; which allows you to leverage Amazon&#8217;s existing distribution network to store and ship your products._

In addition to offering warehousing and shipping, in true Amazon tradition, they&#8217;ve coupled this capability with a programmatic webservices interface. _I think this may be a pretty key differentiator._ It&#8217;s not that Wal*Mart doesn&#8217;t have a business to business (B2B) interface, but [EDI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Data_Interchange "Electronic Data Interchange") can be complex and costly to implement.

_Wal*Mart attempts to server &#8220;the common man&#8221; but it seems clear that Amazon&#8217;s focused on &#8220;the common business&#8221;._

_One last question and thought; Why has this taken so long?_ We can be pedantic about definitions or dissect the statement that innovation can truly not exist without invention. Semantics aside, I believe Amazon&#8217;s practice and &#8220;inventions&#8221; in the webservices technologies has afforded them the &#8220;innovation&#8221; required to bridge this gap.

_PS, if you have the opportunity check out iTunes U_, specifically the presentations by <a title="Thomas Friedman - The World is Flat" href="http://www.thomaslfriedman.com/worldisflat.htm" onmousedown="return rwt(this,'','','res','3','AFQjCNE2Gde70680r7m2iN_yMQNfXevDJg','&sig2=Pv1Rk63kaJof3SnJ1QeOvw')">Thomas L.
