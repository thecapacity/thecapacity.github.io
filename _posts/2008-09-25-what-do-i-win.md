I have a confession to make which probably won’t surprise many of you, least of all my wife. I hope it’s a minor flaw that doesn’t make me too intolerable but the fact is: **I like to be right.**

I don’t believe I’m the “In your face – \*boo yah\* Where’s my $20?” kinda right. **I prefer to consider it as a paternal smugness**, quiet calmness with a wry, knowing “Well, I’m sure you had to figure that out on your own but I just wish I could have made things easier for you” kind of smile.

So I don’t normally go out of my way to toot my own horn but **I wanted to take exception because I think it will illustrate a lot about me**… and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">trust me I’m wrong a fair amount of the time too</span>.

There are [great](http://www.wishfulthinking.co.uk/blog/2008/03/11/is-it-better-to-be-a-creative-generalist-or-a-specialist/) [debates](http://www.cio.com/article/102352/Specialists_vs._Generalists) about “[Generalists vs. Specialists](http://creativegeneralist.blogspot.com/2008/02/what-specifically-do-generalists-do.html)” and “[Consumers vs. Producers](http://www.softwarebyrob.com/2008/05/18/the-single-most-important-career-question-you-can-ask-yourself/)” and I’m sure a ton of other “[Mavens, Connectors, etc…](http://sushantshankar.com/2007/07/20/are-you-a-connector-maven-or-salesman/)” generalizations from [Freakenomics](http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/).

Honestly, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I’m not sure which of any of those labels I truly am</span>. On a Meyers Briggs test [I’m a bit of everything](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2007/11/15/my-sympathies/) and **I sort of think of myself as a guy who could step into many situations and make do**, which probably means a “Consuming Generalist Connector” if one had to pick.

To me it’s reminiscent of that TV show “[The Pretender”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pretender_(TV_series)), minus the genious IQ. I make no illusions that I’d be an adequate Dr. or working at the [LHC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider), but I’ve done marketing, management, business, technology and lots of variations in between.

Most of my friends know that I parse a lot of data, it “feeds my need” and making the connections and tracking the patterns is something I find fulfilling. **Recently, someone told me I have a great mind for strategy and I glossed over the compliment** but in this most recent context it was interesting to reevaluate that statement.

So what was it? What did I do? Simply put, **I did what I enjoy doing; I read and observed and let intuition guide.**

I won’t bore you with a soliloquy about the merits of on demand fabrication and the future, but if you’ve followed any of it you’ve heard about [Ponoko](http://www.ponoko.com/), [BigBlueSaw](http://bigbluesaw.com/) and [Shapeways](http://www.shapeways.com/).

Recently Ponoko [announced an upcoming feature](http://blog.ponoko.com/2008/09/24/announcing-photomake-turn-hand-drawings-into-real-life-things/) release, something to make digital design and fabrication easier and more approachable then [invited people to guess](http://blog.ponoko.com/2008/09/19/another-giant-step-towards-changing-everything/). So [I guessed](http://blog.ponoko.com/2008/09/19/another-giant-step-towards-changing-everything/#comment-9494), not having “the answer” in mind till I started writing my comment but when I wrote I had that sense of knowing I was right.

It wasn’t like competing for a Nobel Prize, there were probably only about 75 other posters but the only other person who mentioned something similar was the one immediately following mine. And now [it’s real](http://blog.ponoko.com/2008/09/24/announcing-photomake-turn-hand-drawings-into-real-life-things/) and people are [excited about it](http://venturebeat.com/2008/09/25/lazy-talentless-ponokos-latest-tool-can-make-you-creative-anyway/).

**Me, I think it’s a great concept and I’m excited too, but I must admit; I’m also excited about being right.** 

**So Ponoko, where’s my prize?**
