I was watching [a presentation](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5795534100478091031 "Stanford's Phoenix") on my iPhone on implementation of MapReduce for multi-core and multi-processor systems…

You can find out more about it [at the project’s website.](http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/sw/phoenix/ "Phoenix")

_Before you go.. note the “~christos” part of the URL._ In UNIX-speak it means “the home directory of the user christos”. That little “squiggle” is called a tilde and is a common syntax, especially for geeks.

_However, the iPhone’s keypad lacks a ‘~’ character!_

Rather then enter a relatively short URL, I had to use some searching on Google to get me there. Not exactly the user experience I think Apple would strive for.
