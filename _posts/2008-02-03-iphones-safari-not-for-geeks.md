I was watching [a presentation](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5795534100478091031 "Stanford's Phoenix") on my iPhone on implementation of MapReduce for multi-core and multi-processor systems&#8230;

You can find out more about it [at the project&#8217;s website.](http://csl.stanford.edu/~christos/sw/phoenix/ "Phoenix")

_Before you go.. note the &#8220;~christos&#8221; part of the URL._ In UNIX-speak it means &#8220;the home directory of the user christos&#8221;. That little &#8220;squiggle&#8221; is called a tilde and is a common syntax, especially for geeks.

_However, the iPhone&#8217;s keypad lacks a &#8216;~&#8217; character!_

Rather then enter a relatively short URL, I had to use some searching on Google to get me there. Not exactly the user experience I think Apple would strive for.
