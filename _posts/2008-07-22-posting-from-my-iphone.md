Although it&#8217;s a bit limited, e.g. creating links, I&#8217;m now able to post from my iPhone!

It&#8217;s not only &#8220;neat&#8221; from a technology perspective but blurrs the lines between blog and social networking site. 

Almost a resurgence to distributed computing environmants. 

After all, why twitter when I can post here, and why lock my data into Facebook and the like if it can be controlled by each individual?

Focusing on API&#8217;s for connecting people&#8217;s various identities and sites will allow it to all feel seemless. 

I can add photos too, once I figure tuat part out. But first thing first&#8230; Can someone get a better spell check please?
