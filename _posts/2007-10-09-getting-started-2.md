It seems there&#8217;s so much to do to first [get started blogging](http://geniustypes.com/how_to_blog_the_manual/ "Genius Types - How to Blog"). Most of it is a &#8220;known&#8221; set of things but there&#8217;s still many ends and outs you have to work through.

My path has been to try to get [content first](http://blog.thecapacity.org/ "thecapacity for content"), simply enforcing the art of practice. Then [analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/ "Google Analytics") because without feedback I have no true incentive to continue. [Ads](https://www.google.com/adsense/login/en_US/?hl-en_US "Google Adsense") are more of an experiment,  just trying something that&#8217;s part of &#8220;the experience&#8221;.

Next comes &#8220;marketing&#8221; to eventually determine the value of my contribution. For starters this; <a href="http://technorati.com/claim/dcc52x6ww" rel="me">Technorati Profile</a>. It&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t expect or hope to invest much time in. Not because I believe &#8220;if I blog it the world will come&#8221; but rather because I want the practice of content to be my priority.

Are there any others ? Oh yes, readers&#8230;
