It seems there’s so much to do to first [get started blogging](http://geniustypes.com/how_to_blog_the_manual/ "Genius Types - How to Blog"). Most of it is a “known” set of things but there’s still many ends and outs you have to work through.

My path has been to try to get [content first](http://blog.thecapacity.org/ "thecapacity for content"), simply enforcing the art of practice. Then [analytics](http://www.google.com/analytics/ "Google Analytics") because without feedback I have no true incentive to continue. [Ads](https://www.google.com/adsense/login/en_US/?hl-en_US "Google Adsense") are more of an experiment, just trying something that’s part of “the experience”.

Next comes “marketing” to eventually determine the value of my contribution. For starters this; <a href="http://technorati.com/claim/dcc52x6ww" rel="me">Technorati Profile</a>. It’s something I don’t expect or hope to invest much time in. Not because I believe “if I blog it the world will come” but rather because I want the practice of content to be my priority.

Are there any others ? Oh yes, readers…
