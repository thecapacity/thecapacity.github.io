Just a quick gripe to share with anyone using [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome).

For all of [Chrome&#8217;s new high performance design](http://blog.chromium.org/), there&#8217;s a very simple way to bring your tabbed experience to it&#8217;s knees,Â Print something&#8230;

In my case it was a 100+ page PDF printed 2 pages per sheet, but I&#8217;m sure most anything of a decent size would work.

Disapopinting to say the least, **since printing is supposed to be a background task**, that&#8217;s why we have spooling, not take front and center stage!
