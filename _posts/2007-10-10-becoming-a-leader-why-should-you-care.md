As I’ve been creating this blog I’ve been having major struggles with what seems like a relatively minor component; the “about you” section. Everything seems to request a description and it’s a sensible position to have, i.e. **why should people care if you can’t even articulate who you are?**

I was recently re-inspired to consider this point while [listening](http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/10/1010_gallo/index_01.htm "Carmine Gallo Presentation") to Carmine Gallo discuss his new book [<cite>Fire Them Up!</cite>](http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Them-InspireColleagues-Communicate-Confidence/dp/0470165669/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/105-6257023-0214830?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1192059614&sr=8-1 "Fire Them Up! at Amazon"). I haven’t read the book, but was reading [_The Seven Secrets of Inspiring Leaders_](http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/oct2007/sb20071010_093227.htm "Seven Secrets of Inspiring Leaders") on BusinessWeek. **The article is a good read** and **I was thrilled by the [audio slide show](http://images.businessweek.com/ss/07/10/1010_gallo/index_01.htm "Carmine's Slide Show") at the end of page two.**

Carmine talks about some aspects of management and the work force today, ones I’ve also been discussing with a colleague of mine. For example, Carmine mentions that **“GenXers” are twice as likely to want weekly feedback** vs “BabyBoomers” [in general I hate the generational labeling but it’s convenient conceptually]. Another point I found insightful was the elucidation that **GenXers aren’t driven by a “get rich quick” philosophy but rather crave empowerment**. It’s a powerful distinction, and misunderstanding that I’ve often seen in my own career.

So **how does this relate to “about me” ?** Well, another interesting concept Carmine presents is that when he was learning to write he continually pondered the question; “**Why do my readers care?**“.

I’d like nothing more than to be able to finish this post with a witty and inspiring paragraph about why I’m so amazing that you need to care. **Unfortunately, I think many bloggers over-hype themselves in this way.** 

**I believe a single description is too simplistic an approach and that only content can prove value.**

**I do believe I can share value**, that I’m intelligent and contribute insight and experience. However, **maybe you care because you agree** with my points, or **maybe you care because you disagree**. If I hold a single “ultimate hope” it’s that **what might make you care enough is that I cause enough intrigue for you to consider things individually and to share those insights with us all.**

**Ultimately, I can’t tell you why you’d care, and I fear trying to do so would remove from you that sense of feedback and empowerment that I think we all crave.**

**What do you think? Is attempting to describe this activity an ultimate limit on why we all care?**
