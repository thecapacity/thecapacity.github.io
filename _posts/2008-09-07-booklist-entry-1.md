My wife and I have really been enjoying our local public library. Unfortunately, it’s nothing spectacular so the truth is that we’re really enjoying its website. 

Online you can search and reserve books, so it’s a bit like Amazon meets NetFlix in a Wild West showdown!

I really wish you could queue and prioritize books and perhaps link it with my real Amazon list. However, until I figure something out (please correct me if you know where Amazon’s wishlist API is) I’m content trying to self manage.

So I thought I’d share a pick of my recent book. Combined we’ve probably managed to go through 30 since we started!

Hope you’re enjoying some reading too!
