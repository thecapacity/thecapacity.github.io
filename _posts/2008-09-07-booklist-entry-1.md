My wife and I have really been enjoying our local public library. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s nothing spectacular so the truth is that we&#8217;re really enjoying its website. 

Online you can search and reserve books, so it&#8217;s a bit like Amazon meets NetFlix in a Wild West showdown!

I really wish you could queue and prioritize books and perhaps link it with my real Amazon list. However, until I figure something out (please correct me if you know where Amazon&#8217;s wishlist API is) I&#8217;m content trying to self manage.

So I thought I&#8217;d share a pick of my recent book. Combined we&#8217;ve probably managed to go through 30 since we started!

Hope you&#8217;re enjoying some reading too!
