**As an exercise in citizen participation in Government I developed a [Digital Government Tracker](http://digitalgov-tracker.wjhuie.com/).**

At a pivotal time in history, a famous man once said: _“Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”_ – Gettysburg Address

It’s been almost 150 years since those words were first spoken, but the sentiment remains; a Nation, founded on principles and great expectations must continue to uphold those values, despite great change and through great turmoil.

**Certainly no founding father, or citizen, could imagine all the challenges a Nation would face**, and the strength of our Government is that _“it can always be changed … the beauty of the Constitution is that it makes no set law other than faith in the wisdom of ordinary people to govern themselves.”_<sup><a title="1" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111732/quotes">1</a></sup>

**This philosophy, and mandate for constant reaffirmation and reinvention, has never been truer than in the digital age we live in now.**

I couldn’t state the case any better than to quote two other great characters in history;

  * _“In 2011, global smartphone shipments exceeded personal computer shipments for the first time in history, and more Americans will soon access the Internet via mobile devices than desktop PCs.”_<sup><a title="1" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2012/05/23/roadmap-digital-government">2</a></sup>
  * and ultimately that the _“innovative use of technology is fundamentally transforming how the American people do business and live their daily lives.”_<sup><a title="3" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/23/presidential-memorandum-building-21st-century-digital-government">3</a></sup>

**The new U.S. [Digital Governmental Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html) attempts to outline how agencies can safely embrace this latest challenge, among the many that technology constantly brings.**

Throughout this strategy, and activities such as the [Open Government Initiative](http://www.whitehouse.gov/open/about "Open Government Initiative"), I believe there are two overarching implications, beyond the obvious technical considerations:

  1. **Citizens matter** – Leaders in the ‘civic hacking’ community such as [Jennifer Pahlka](http://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_pahlka_coding_a_better_government.html "Jennifer Pahlka"), [Sunlight Labs](http://sunlightlabs.com/ "Sunlight Labs"), reporters such as [Alex Howard](https://twitter.com/#!/digiphile "Alex Howard"), leaders like [Todd Park](http://twitter.com/#!/todd_park "Todd Park"), and many others have shown us that innovations and expectations outside government, can be pushed/pulled into the realm of agencies.
  2. **Evidence-based impact** – Never before has there been such an opportunity to illustrate the correlation between cost and value [in our Government’s budget](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2012/m-12-14_1.pdf) _(pdf)_. Technology provides empirical data like nothing else and, given some of the high profile successes and failures in Federal IT, I think technology can link the cost of doing business with the civic value citizens expect and deserve (think SLA’s for Federal services).

Certainly there are are some [high profile](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions) [efforts](http://mobility-strategy.ideascale.com/a/topContributors.do) to engage citizens in these activities, but when the  [WhiteHouse github account](https://github.com/whitehouse) has only 2 followers _(as of 6/2/2012)_ I can’t help but feel like the evidence for change is still unfolding.

**Rather than being daunted by the circumstances, I decided to be inspired by these _‘digital government heroes’_.** I’m sure we’ll never be a country where developers get a [nanoKardishian](http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2012/05/02/an-idea-worth-at-least-40-nanokardashians-of-your-attention/) of attention, or receive the  [star treatment](http://www.boardgamemovie.com/) Europe bestows on board-game designers.

However, there is an important transformation looming, for geeks not just government. **So I decided to create a personal project to, quite literally, codify some of my experiences and I’ve made it [open source](https://github.com/thecapacity/digitalgov-tracker), to pay a small debt of gratitude to some of the [geeks in government](http://ben.balter.com/about/ "geeks in government").**

This [Digital Government Tracker](http://digitalgov-tracker.wjhuie.com) highlights, and tracks progress on, two elements of the [Digital Government Strategy](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html) and the accompanying [Presidential Memorandum](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/05/23/presidential-memorandum-building-21st-century-digital-government).

Specifically the requirements for every agency to establish:

  * Per the Presidential Memo, in 90 days: <a>www.[agency].gov/digitalstrategy</a>
  * Per the Digital Strategy, in 12 months: <a>agency.gov/developer</a>

**One of the interesting lessons I learned through this exercise, was that agencies are required to create two websites!**

Although I have not participated in the creation of these policies, I have been involved as an analyst and advocate for government transformation, and **my experience suggests that most participants assumed there was only URL.**

**I think this is a great example of how making dialogues tangible, through technology, reduces ambiguity and improves the results.**

This site owes much to the [SunlightLabs](http://sunlightlabs.com/) and the  [/Open Watcher](http://sunlightlabs.com/open/) site. [NIST](http://www.nist.gov) also has an excellent  [IPv6 and DNSSEC Deployment Monitor](http://fedv6-deployment.antd.nist.gov/) that may be a relative first in tracking success through empirical evidence based assessment. Perhaps [The Government Accountability Office](http://www.gao.gov/) could partner with [The Office of Management and Budget](http://www.omb.gov) to developed these techniques, making process of government, not just its citizen services, more efficient and effective.

_“I want us to ask ourselves every day, how are we using technology to make a real difference in people’s lives.”_<sup><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/digital-government/digital-government.html">4</a></sup> – President Barack Obama

I hope in some small way this manages to help.
