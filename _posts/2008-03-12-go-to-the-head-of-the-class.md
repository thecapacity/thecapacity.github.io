Yay, I made it to Highschool!

No, I’m not really headed back to school, just enjoying a moment of brevity with the “[Blog Readability Test](http://www.criticsrant.com/bb/reading_level.aspx "Blog Readability Test")”

I wouldn’t take it too seriously as I’m not sure how a “determination” is made, but that’s kind of the point sometimes.

Make sure to stay light and enjoy what you can!
