Yay, I made it to Highschool!

No, I&#8217;m not really headed back to school, just enjoying a moment of brevity with the &#8220;[Blog Readability Test](http://www.criticsrant.com/bb/reading_level.aspx "Blog Readability Test")&#8221;

I wouldn&#8217;t take it too seriously as I&#8217;m not sure how a &#8220;determination&#8221; is made, but that&#8217;s kind of the point sometimes.

Make sure to stay light and enjoy what you can!
