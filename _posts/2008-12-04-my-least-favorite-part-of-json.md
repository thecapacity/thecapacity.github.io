I love how simple the JSON spec is. I never enjoyed reading through all the XML closures, etc. JSON just feels more programming so you don’t have to shift your brain as much as you do with XML.

However, I hate that ” is the only quoting character you can use. I’ve come to love python’s equal tolerance for ‘c’ and “c”.

I like that JSON’s simple but wish it was simply more accommodating.
