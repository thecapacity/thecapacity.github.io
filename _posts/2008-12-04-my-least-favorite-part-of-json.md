I love how simple the JSON spec is. I never enjoyed reading through all the XML closures, etc. JSON just feels more programming so you don&#8217;t have to shift your brain as much as you do with XML.

However, I hate that &#8221; is the only quoting character you can use. I&#8217;ve come to love python&#8217;s equal tolerance for &#8216;c&#8217; and &#8220;c&#8221;.

I like that JSON&#8217;s simple but wish it was simply more accommodating.
