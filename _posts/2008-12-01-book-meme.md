Time for a little bit of nonsense.

I was following the news that [Pownce is dead](http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2008/12/welcome-pownce-team.html) and started reading some of Leah Culver’s [blog entries](http://leahculver.com/), which I usually try to check in every so often but don’t have in my feed for some reason. Loh and behold I found that [she’s been playing with CouchDB too](http://leahculver.com/2008/11/25/couchdb-documents-python-objects/)!

It’s always rewarding to know that someone who’s made such a professional impact is exploring things the same as I am (although I’m sure her learning curve is faster then mine ;> ).

In one of her posts I stumbled across the “[book meme](http://leahculver.com/2008/11/13/book-meme/)“. I don’t really listen to music like I should or enjoy a lot of the “fill in this questionnaire” memes that go around, but books… now that I can get into!

So here’s mine;

**“If the yeast is active, it will have at least doubled its volume with a frothy head.” – Caveman Chemistry by Kevin M Dunn.**

Book meme:

– Grab the nearest book.
  
– Open it to page 56.
  
– Find the fifth sentence.
  
– Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.
  
– Don’t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.
