Time for a little bit of nonsense.

I was following the news that [Pownce is dead](http://www.sixapart.com/blog/2008/12/welcome-pownce-team.html) and started reading some of Leah Culver&#8217;s [blog entries](http://leahculver.com/), which I usually try to check in every so often but don&#8217;t have in my feed for some reason. Loh and behold I found that [she&#8217;s been playing with CouchDB too](http://leahculver.com/2008/11/25/couchdb-documents-python-objects/)!

It&#8217;s always rewarding to know that someone who&#8217;s made such a professional impact is exploring things the same as I am (although I&#8217;m sure her learning curve is faster then mine ;> ).

In one of her posts I stumbled across the &#8220;[book meme](http://leahculver.com/2008/11/13/book-meme/)&#8220;. I don&#8217;t really listen to music like I should or enjoy a lot of the &#8220;fill in this questionnaire&#8221; memes that go around, but books&#8230; now that I can get into!

So here&#8217;s mine;

**&#8220;If the yeast is active, it will have at least doubled its volume with a frothy head.&#8221; &#8211; Caveman Chemistry by Kevin M Dunn.**

Book meme:

&#8211; Grab the nearest book.
  
&#8211; Open it to page 56.
  
&#8211; Find the fifth sentence.
  
&#8211; Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.
  
&#8211; Donâ€™t dig for your favorite book, the cool book, or the intellectual one: pick the CLOSEST.
