This is the second book in a row that I&#8217;ve really enjoyed so it might be easy to say I was on a roll picking winners. Yet, to do so would negate all I&#8217;d learned from &#8220;[The Drunkard&#8217;s Walk](http://www.amazon.com/Drunkards-Walk-Randomness-Rules-Lives/dp/0375424040&tag=thecapacity-20)&#8221; which is a fantastic journey into &#8220;how randomness rules our lives&#8221;!

First, let me start with the ending which directly addresses the question that always springs to mind when people explain how randomness underlies most everything, even supposed patterns or successes. I&#8217;ll just mention that Leonard Mlondinow concludes his book by confronting this concept in a heartfelt manner and I can only encourage you all not to lose hope by the rest of my post.

The term &#8220;Brownian Motion&#8221; is a more polite term for the drunkard&#8217;s walk, but I&#8217;m sure many of us are familiar with the concept that we often get to where we were going without always intentionally steering ourselves there directly.

Before I started my book list entries I read &#8220;The Black Swan&#8221; based on a friend&#8217;s recommendation. It&#8217;s a good book too but I felt like it left me with more questions (although with more respect and caution, and my second book gave me a sense of how our underlying psychology can &#8220;randomly&#8221; (or not so randomly) influence our lives.

This book really seemed to pull a lot of those same concepts into both a historical and tangible set of examples.

The author,  <span><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Leonard%20Mlodinow">Leonard Mlodinow</a>, brings to our attention the risks of </span>&#8220;[confirmation bias](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)&#8221; and how often it influences our expectation of whether something is or isn&#8217;t random.

About the only point where I &#8220;disagreed&#8221; (i.e. where I wanted to have a more in depth conversation) was when he mentions that firing high level managers shows a 50% rate of improvement.

His point is that this shows that managers don&#8217;t always have any influence whatsoever but I wonder if it simply means that only roughly 50% of all managers are good.

In short I think Leonard falls prey to something he often guards against if you use statistics to generalize (as he did here) then you miss out that often results can go &#8220;counter&#8221; to the trend for the individual, i.e. instead of &#8220;breaking even&#8221; you could see a 100% improvement in you rcompoany (probably at the expense of another which ends up @ -100%).

However, given that I&#8217;m not a mathematician I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;m falling prey to the influences that we all suffer from, understanding how randomness predominates our existence. Clearly I could use some more reading on this subject but this book is a great start in that direction!
