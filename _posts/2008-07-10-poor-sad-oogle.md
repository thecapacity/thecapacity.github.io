**I don’t know if that’s how he spells his name, but just now… I think I broke his heart…
  
** 

If the records are correct, **unbeknownst to me****, Oogle and I have apparently had a close knit relationship**. Oh, and **there’s Ivan too… who was much happier to learn about my existence,** “3 years!” he exclaimed. But, **ultimately, it was Oogle who had to bear the brunt of the bad news.**

**It probably seems a strange post, but you see I feel the need to represent Oogle just a little bit.** Perhaps it’s because we’ve been such old friends. Or maybe it’s to cover the remorse I feel for having to call it off after so long.

You see today, I canceled my Vonage phone number. **I was expecting [some](http://blog.tmcnet.com/blog/tom-keating/vonage/cancelling-vonage-difficulties.asp) [horror](http://www.velocityreviews.com/forums/t303954-how-do-i-cancel-vonage.html) stories, but for me it was a mostly non-painful process.**

I logged into my Vonage account and couldn’t find a way to cancel (or even a contact number) so of course I did the next best thing… I googled it! What I found was more then a few dire warnings, but I managed to find a phone number to call and screwed up my courage as well.

Someone posted a number so I gave it a go and was promptly greeted by an automated message telling me the number was out of service and that I should call “1-Vonage-Help”… **Now of course I’m hoping you all are as puzzled as I was, by why they didn’t simply redirect me, but remember Ivan…**

Once I dialed the proper number there was a nice set of prompts asking me my phone # and what I wanted to do. I said “cancel my account” and the system was quite happy to have understood me correctly and sent me, without a significant delay to Ivan.

Apparently, Ivan works in the Billing Department and after expressing his dismay at losing such a long valued customer (“3 years! Why would you want to cancel?”) he informed me I needed to talk with someone from Account Management and happily transfered me over (**honestly, he was quite pleasant to talk to**).

That’s when I met Oogle… **Imagine stopping by the southeast corner of the [Hundred Acre Wood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Acre_Wood "Hundred Acre Wood") and having to tell the [resident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eeyore) the sad sad news**… Oogle offered me a discounted package but was shocked when I told him I had no highspeed internet at home. **“I get enough of it at work” I told him, though I believe my wit, as usual, was underappreciated.**

After assuring him I had no immediate plans to change my connectivity situation, he inquired as to whether or not I would transfer my number to someone else… That was an interesting twist, but **I assured him that everyone I could think of already had phones** and even though he made on last inquisition if there was any suggestion I had that would make me stay he asked a few questions (with long pauses in between) and graciously closed me account.

I know Vonage [has](http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/06/30/ap5169077.html) [had](http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080709/BUSINESS/807090332/1003) [issues](http://www.tmcnet.com/news/2008/07/02/3528470.htm) as a company but things might be [looking](http://www.sunherald.com/prnewswire/story/677243.html) [up](http://www.consumeraffairs.com/news04/2008/07/comcast_vonage.html) for them. They’ve been exactly what I needed (i.e. not much) from a home phone service and apparently they’ve learned that not all relationships are built to last, **even ones with guys like Ivan and Oogle…**
