The always fabulous Louis Grey makes [good points](http://www.louisgray.com/live/2009/07/gmail-should-be-hub-of-your-companys.html) about using GMail in a corporate environment and got me thinking in a different direction.

I begain to consider: **Why can&#8217;t I share emails the same way I can share RSS entries?**

Google Reader allows you to publish all entries you tagged with specific keywords, or you can share entries on an individual basis. Yet, **despite the obvious analogue, it&#8217;s impossible for me to share email messages or threads in the same manner!**

I realize there are some privacy concerns, since RSS & Atom explicitly make things public and email does not. However, there&#8217;s no reading I couldn&#8217;t use an email to RSS gateway and violate expected convention easily.

I might also argue that by opening up email to the same type of social collaboration we get via Google Reader then **the potential would exist to make things more secure**.

For example, by adding a default copy-left style licensing, a la creative commons, or a per-email &#8220;off the record&#8221; flag like Google Talk. There could even be &#8220;free to share&#8221; delivery options rather then keeping everything on an &#8220;honor system&#8221;.
