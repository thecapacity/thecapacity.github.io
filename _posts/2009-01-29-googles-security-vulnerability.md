Let&#8217;s be honest, I really like Google. Without them I couldn&#8217;t be as productive or near as smart as I am today. I often tell people, the most important Quotient out there isn&#8217;t Intelligence or Emotional, it&#8217;s their Google IQ. It&#8217;s OK if you don&#8217;t know it&#8230; but if you can&#8217;t find it then you&#8217;re in trouble.

I [mentioned previously](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2008/09/09/google-chrome-fails-the-google-incognito-test/) that Google&#8217;s browser, Chrome, fails what I consider to be an important security test, but **I&#8217;ve been largely silent on another issue Google seems to have ignored.**

**However, I can only conclude that it&#8217;s a threat larger then we faced with GMail and should be rectified quickly.**

Initially, when GMail was released it had no comprehensive security, i.e. most of the communication between you and GMail was unencrypted. Immediately, there was a outcry from the computing-public (at least those savvy enough to understand the implications) and [Grease Monkey scripts](http://diveintogreasemonkey.org/casestudy/gmailsecure.html) were written to force an encrypted connection for all the transactions and now it&#8217;s an [easily configured feature](http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=74765) in GMail&#8217;s settings.

**However, the same flaw has systematically been overlooked in Google Reader.** As any ATOM / RSS convert knows, feeds have become a critical component of our computing existence and as any social network participant knows&#8230; they&#8217;re notÂ  just for websites anymore.

Gone are the days when RSS was used simply for notifications that a public post or comment had been written. Now it&#8217;s used for some of my most intimate (at least of the digital sort) conversations. **I get everything from status messages (which on Facebook aren&#8217;t as public as on twitter) to direct private messages all sent to my reader. Not only are they sent unencrypted, but even worse I&#8217;m forced to use an unencrypted connection to read them.**

Historically, email was rarely encrypted on the wire when it was sent from the sender to the receiver&#8217;s email system, although that has recently changed. **However, the main security concer with GMail was anyone on the same network could view the contents of their inbox as they were reading their messages!**

I really don&#8217;t use email all that much anymore and instead rely on social networks and RSS notifications for the bulk of my personal communications. **Which, thanks to Google Reader&#8217;s lack of an encrypted configuration, is sent free and in the clear!**

**I think it&#8217;s time Google acknowledges the role and responsibility that Google Reader has in people&#8217;s private lives and works to properly secrure that information.**
