I intended to try my hand at making some videos for this post, but it didn&#8217;t happen after a day and I&#8217;d rather post out the experience while it&#8217;s fresh, then wait. It&#8217;s likely a benefit for you as well because **my poor video skills might distract from the content, however &#8220;seeing is believing&#8221; so you&#8217;ll have to do your best to visualize!**

Sunday my wife and I went to B&N to start on our Christmas shopping. It&#8217;s a longer story to explain why we were shopping at a brick and mortar store but in the end, despite going to the counter with many purchases, we actually left everything there because we couldn&#8217;t receive the discount we expected.

That&#8217;s the context however, and not really the point of this post and it&#8217;s enough to realize that **we were gleefully book shopping as the two of us love to do. During this I experienced a few ways in which my iPhone became a &#8220;game changer&#8221; for me.**

I&#8217;m really not one to &#8220;brag&#8221; about my gadgets and I hate it when people show you every little feature of something they have, especially when it doesn&#8217;t seem that impressive. However, in about an hour **here&#8217;s the evolution of my experience that night and the ways the iPhone &#8220;clicked&#8221; for me.**

  1. **Take a photo of a book I&#8217;m interested in remembering** &#8211; I&#8217;ve done this with my old phone and even had a set of scripts so I could text message ISBN numbers to add books to my &#8220;to read&#8221; list. However, with the iPhone&#8217;s big screen this becomes a more satisfying (and less squinting) experience.
  2. **Looked up the price for [Wikinomics](http://www.amazon.com/Wikinomics-Mass-Collaboration-Changes-Everything/dp/1591841380/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196775126&sr=8-1 "Wikinomics")** &#8211; My wife handed me this book and I was instantly sold, however I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was a reasonable price. So I opened up Safari and went to [I intended to try my hand at making some videos for this post, but it didn&#8217;t happen after a day and I&#8217;d rather post out the experience while it&#8217;s fresh, then wait.

So I opened up Safari and went to](http://www.amazon.com/ "Amazon.com") and checked their price. Amazon has an iPhone optimized page and it was a very &#8220;instantly satisfying&#8221; experience.
  3. **Facebook&#8217;d someone with a question** &#8211; We&#8217;d been talking about buying a &#8220;family game&#8221; for holiday entertainment, but weren&#8217;t sure if the family in question owned the game. So I hopped on the Facebook&#8217;s iPhone page and left a message. I got a response in about 5 minutes so we knew we could get the game right then!
  4. **Called my wife when I got lost** &#8211; Granted it&#8217;s not the most iPhone specific activity and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all done this before. However what &#8220;clicked&#8221; was when I realized **I&#8217;d done everything with the same device!** It wasn&#8217;t a matter of having to pull my cellphone out for this specific activity.
  5. **Had our shopping list emailed to me** &#8211; My wife had a &#8220;note&#8221; on her iPhone with the books we were looking for, and we decided it would be better to split up, so she simply emailed me a copy of the list. **Technology actually making it easy to share!**
  6. **I decided to check the Colts score** &#8211; We couldn&#8217;t watch the end of the game because of time constraints but at least I could find out who won. Again it&#8217;s not iPhone specific but **this is when I started to realize I could &#8220;play&#8221; with the connectivity provided by my &#8220;phone&#8221;.**
  7. **Checked Amazon for book reviews &#8211;** I was caught up in the programming section and pulled up Amazon to check out the reviews for the &#8220;[Python Essential Reference](http://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-Developers-Library/dp/0672328623/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1196775750&sr=8-1 "Python Essential Reference")&#8220;. **It made me feel &#8220;not alone&#8221; in trying to decide the value of something.**

I&#8217;m sure many of the geeks among you have utilized similar functions to fulfill similar situations, for me this was just &#8220;my time&#8221; to &#8220;get it&#8221;.

**I realized in the span of an hour how in many ways a still naive tool could make my life more &#8220;[seemless](http://blog.thecapacity.org/?p=24 "Seemless integration")&#8220;. I****t&#8217;s less about the specifics and more about the realization of what&#8217;s to come, and I want more!**
