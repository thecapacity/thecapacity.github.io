6 weeks! Wow, yes it&#8217;s really been that long since I started reading _[Programming Collective Intelligence](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2008/04/17/oreilly-make-me-an-offer/ "My Programming Collective Intelligence Errata")_ and last posted here.

A lot has happened during that time, my wife got a new job and because of that we moved. We&#8217;re both happy about the chance to &#8220;evolve&#8221; and I think it&#8217;s going to enable a lot of opportunities. But clearly there&#8217;s been many things going on as a result. I&#8217;ve been lucky in being able to continue in my current job and am &#8220;just&#8221; transitioning to a remote employee working full time out of a home office.

I really like having a traditional office with people to &#8220;work with&#8221; (whether it&#8217;s directly or indirectly) but I&#8217;m actually enjoying the work at home (WAH) aspect too. Long term I want to manage IT professionals and I believe that will inherently entail remote employees, so I think the chance to be one for a while will garner me a lot of experience and understanding.

I&#8217;m also excited about being nearby some fantastic friends, whom I&#8217;ve known for a very long time, although it means &#8220;trading&#8221; the fantastic &#8220;local&#8221; friends. I don&#8217;t ever believe you have to &#8220;play favorites&#8221; with friends, I&#8217;ve certainly got enough love to go around, and it&#8217;s exciting to be &#8220;forced&#8221; to use social technologies to keep up with the ones I&#8217;m leaving behind and also to also use those tools in my new location as well.

This should also signal a return to &#8220;projecting&#8221; for me, which is another event I&#8217;m particularly excited about. It&#8217;s not all roses though, I can&#8217;t remember the PW on my wireless router, my office is still a mess with boxes everywhere and my home server was DoA.So it&#8217;s going to mean a technology upgrade (and I need to buy my wife a new computer too) and a lot of threads to tidy up but in the end I really feel positive about the shift.

Hopefully you&#8217;ve not all forgotten about me and you&#8217;ll forgive my absence. I hope I perhaps just sat idle in your RSS feeds and you didn&#8217;t feel the need to purge me because of the silence.
