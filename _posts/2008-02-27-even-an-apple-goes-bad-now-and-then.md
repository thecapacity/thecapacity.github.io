_I seem to be having a confluence of technology issues recently._

Dreamhost, which I&#8217;ve loved until now can&#8217;t seem to follow through on a simple request (so that I can pay them!!!). And that 1TB drive I &#8220;gave&#8221; myself for Christmas has failed and the manufacturer hasn&#8217;t returned my service call.

To top if off, _last night I managed to &#8220;break&#8221; my iPhone._ It&#8217;s not physical damage, but now I&#8217;m unable to &#8220;take&#8221; a picture, something I enjoy doing so I can post them to various places.

Things seem to work ok from the shutter closing, but when I go into the camera roll to look at the saved photos, there&#8217;s now an empty thumbnail. Selecting the thumbnail causes the photo roll to crash.

I believe the mistake was in using Microsoft XP&#8217;s &#8220;camera services&#8221; to delete the 330+ photos I had saved, obviously not something I&#8217;d do by hand. Every time my wife and I sync our phones I have windows configured to copy off the pictures, but this time I&#8217;m sure Windows in all it&#8217;s glory decided to set a bit somewhere the iPhone doesn&#8217;t expecting.

A firmware upgrade to 1.1.4 didn&#8217;t fix, and when I went to restore I got an error even then; 1602. Apparently that means I&#8217;m supposed to completely remove iTunes and Quicktime from my wife&#8217;s computer and reinstall everything.

I&#8217;m can&#8217;t even able to get an image upload working to show you the error message &#8230;.

_It&#8217;s rough, but manageable. It just means time working through various support queues._

_The important realization is that everyone and everything disappoints in some way&#8230; this is life after all. We&#8217;re usually lucky in that failures are rarely life threatening or permanent._

_Avoiding the potential for failure is in and of itself a disappointment, for without the effort I wouldn&#8217;t have joy of toys that are cool when they work. If you take them in stride and carry past the implications, anything is surmountable._

_So soldier on&#8230; but [be careful](http://www.swiatocha-wyble.com/2008/02/23/be-careful/ "Be Careful, because I love you")_
