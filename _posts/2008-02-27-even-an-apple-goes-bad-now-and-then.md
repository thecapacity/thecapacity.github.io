_I seem to be having a confluence of technology issues recently._

Dreamhost, which I’ve loved until now can’t seem to follow through on a simple request (so that I can pay them!!!). And that 1TB drive I “gave” myself for Christmas has failed and the manufacturer hasn’t returned my service call.

To top if off, _last night I managed to “break” my iPhone._ It’s not physical damage, but now I’m unable to “take” a picture, something I enjoy doing so I can post them to various places.

Things seem to work ok from the shutter closing, but when I go into the camera roll to look at the saved photos, there’s now an empty thumbnail. Selecting the thumbnail causes the photo roll to crash.

I believe the mistake was in using Microsoft XP’s “camera services” to delete the 330+ photos I had saved, obviously not something I’d do by hand. Every time my wife and I sync our phones I have windows configured to copy off the pictures, but this time I’m sure Windows in all it’s glory decided to set a bit somewhere the iPhone doesn’t expecting.

A firmware upgrade to 1.1.4 didn’t fix, and when I went to restore I got an error even then; 1602. Apparently that means I’m supposed to completely remove iTunes and Quicktime from my wife’s computer and reinstall everything.

I’m can’t even able to get an image upload working to show you the error message ….

_It’s rough, but manageable. It just means time working through various support queues._

_The important realization is that everyone and everything disappoints in some way… this is life after all. We’re usually lucky in that failures are rarely life threatening or permanent._

_Avoiding the potential for failure is in and of itself a disappointment, for without the effort I wouldn’t have joy of toys that are cool when they work. If you take them in stride and carry past the implications, anything is surmountable._

_So soldier on… but [be careful](http://www.swiatocha-wyble.com/2008/02/23/be-careful/ "Be Careful, because I love you")_
