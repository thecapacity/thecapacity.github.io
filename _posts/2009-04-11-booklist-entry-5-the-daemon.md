I heard about this book while listening to a talk the author gave at a &#8220;[Long Now Foundation](http://www.longnow.org/)&#8221; meeting via their iTunes podcast. Apparently, [Stewart Brand](http://www.longnow.org/people/board/brand.php) got an early copy and it was passed around enough to gain quite a bit of popularity.

Well, after vomiting my way through an Ops Center story and a few other bad &#8220;tech fiction&#8221; books, I don&#8217;t think of myself as one to dive into the hype about a new book unless it&#8217;s from someone who&#8217;s name ends in [Gibson](http://www.williamgibsonbooks.com/blog/blog.asp), [Bear](http://www.gregbear.com/), [Stephenson](http://www.nealstephenson.com/) or the like.

However, I really respect the Foundation (they&#8217;ve got an amazing vision and a bunch of cool members after all) so I thought this one might be interesting enough to give it a try.

**[_Daemon_](http://www.thedaemon.com/)** is based heavily on the premise of AI and [natural language parsing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) but what was even more interesting to me was the distributed systems approach represented in the book, I&#8217;ve always been a sucker for grid-like systems.

You can find the plot overview anywhere you like so I won&#8217;t bother recreating it here, but I will tell you, **yes, it&#8217;s a good book**, though it has probably been so well received due to the current economic state and fears.

At times I felt like the technical stuff was polarized between kiddy-gloved explanations or glossed over like magic. However, it&#8217;s clear the author focused on actual technological facts and didn&#8217;t suffer any &#8220;[I know this!](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/quotes)&#8221; crap or pretend [hacking had visual displays](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0113243/).

I also thought the story spent some credibility &#8220;justifying&#8221; its realism, e.g. explicitly calling it narrow-AI (i.e. expert systems). If you have to split hairs then maybe you&#8217;re too worried about disclaimers and not focusing enough on the story, but I guarantee you that Suarez has more then enough here for a [sequel](http://www.thedaemon.com/freedomtmpreview.html).

If you take the &#8220;futuristic&#8221; parts on faith (which is required for any good sci-fi book) then you can ignore the other bits as you see fit and **I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll be well entertained and even a little torn as to which side to cheer for!**

Also, if you like this one I highly recommend giving any of the books by [Charles Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/faq.html) a try. **Specifically [Halting State](http://www.amazon.com/Halting-State-Charles-Stross/dp/B001CJP2MY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239493461&sr=1-1&tag=thecapacity-20), which seems to have a lot of overlapping & parallels themes and was even more enjoyabale for me, but only just**
