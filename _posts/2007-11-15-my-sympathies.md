With a wife with majors in Psychology and Counseling I&#8217;ve absorbed some of her skepticism of popular personality assessments. However, she and I both feel they&#8217;re interesting ways of starting a dialog about how people approach their environment.

I took a few assessments at work for a Teamwork class and remember myself as an &#8220;INSP&#8221;. Most friends are shocked at the &#8216;I&#8217; because I seem to do fine around people, but I recharge best by having some solo time. For the Intuitive and Sensing I&#8217;m stronger on the Intuit side but was almost 50/50 between Sensing and Thinking. While I was midline on most of the traits, Perceiving (vs. Judging) was the trait where I was most strongly identified.

In their blog, [dbug](http://blog.reindel.com/ "dbug "), Brian & Stephanie Reindel discuss the role of personality in [&#8220;The Architect and the Mastermind&#8221;.](http://blog.reindel.com/2007/11/09/the-architect-and-the-mastermind/ "Architect and the Mastermind") In their examples I thought it was interesting the Thinking trait seemed dominant, however although I seem more of an &#8216;S&#8217; I still sympathize with the article&#8217;s statement;

> &#8220;I possess an insatiable desire to build something useful. The sole purpose of any system is to be the focus of my criticism, and suggestions for improvement are a necessary outlet. Any application I build, after finished, is undeniably worthless, and must be completely refined, streamlined, and re-built.&#8221;

I&#8217;m sure &#8220;worthless&#8221; was meant spiritually as in the ever pursuit of perfection, but I suffer from many forms of this flaw. I&#8217;m less fearful of something actually being worthless, because that would imply I finished. Perhaps a greater failing is creating something never shared, and thus worthless to the greater good.

However, this personality trait manifests in more insidious was, such as when I quit before I finish because I perceive flaws too strongly. Or I capitulate by investing too much upfront time, never actually starting and thus never technically failing, but the end result is the same or worse then having failed in the attempt.

That was one realization I had from reading their article. For some other interesting perspectives of your own check it out.
