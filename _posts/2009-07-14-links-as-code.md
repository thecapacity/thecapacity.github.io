John Willis&#8217; &#8220;[Infrastructure as Code](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/cloud-computing/infrastructure-as-code/)&#8221; should be a startling epiphany for anyone who has long neglected process and people in favor of technological solutions. Yet, I hope anyone here doesn&#8217;t need convincing about the validity of institutionalizing the collective knowledge

**However, I wonder about a critical level of infrastructure maintenance that seems to be missed, document maintenance.**

I&#8217;m sure everyone has experienced the frustration of reading a document with an invalid URL, but is this be accepted?

Should documents not be kept in repositories as well? Why not take the same proactive approach to maintaining links as we do &#8220;[Not breaking the Build](http://www.jspwiki.org/wiki/DontBreakTheBuild)&#8221; when programming?

**So why doesn&#8217;t your team have a utility to scan internal documents and links when they propose changing page structures, before they&#8217;re made live?**
