As promised in my earlier post I wanted to be more active in continuing my reviews, and this is a book worth the accolades.

**In “<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Predictably-Irrational-Hidden-Forces-Decisions/dp/006135323X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1224337461&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20" target="_blank">Predictably Irrational</a>” the author, Dan Ariely, gives us a chance face some of the most astounding incongruities of the human persona.**

**I couldn’t do all the examples justice** but let’s take one of the “classic” observations. Assume you’re given a description of a woman who was politically and environmentally active in college. You even learn that she was arrested once for chaining herself to a tree! Then you’re asked which of these futures she’s most likely to have;

> (a) Working in the finance industry as a bank teller
> 
> (b) Single parent working as a counselor for battered women
> 
> (c) Doing social work

Now I’m not the scientist Dan is but assuming I’ve not completely missed the tone, many, even most, of us might answer option (b) as being the most probable path of our fictious female.

However, if we step back from our human instincts we realize that (b) is actually a more “specific subset” (my words not the authors) of option (c)!! So because of it’s broader categorization picking (**c) stands a better chance of being correct but because (b) appeals to our “sense of story”** we tend to gravitate towards it being most probable!

Short of recreating the book in a blog post **there’s no way I could do these examples and insights justice** but i**f you enjoy learning about how we’re “mislead”** (a polite term) as consumers, **or why we don’t always make “logical” decisions** (though they are as the title suggests “irrational in a predictable manner”) then **this is the book for you!**

**It’s a well written book which has digestible chapters and a story like progression that make it enticingly easy and insightful to read!**
