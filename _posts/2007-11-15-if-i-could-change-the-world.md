I often think I have good ideas, but I tend to be a &#8220;thinker&#8221; and have problems &#8220;doing&#8221;. It&#8217;s not that I can&#8217;t &#8220;do&#8221; it&#8217;s usually the familiar feeling of saying &#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if&#8230;&#8221; quickly followed by &#8220;yea, and it would also be nice if I had time for that&#8221; which I&#8217;m sure we can all sympathize with.

I recently read [Accelerando](http://www.amazon.com/Accelerando-Charles-Stross/dp/0441014151/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1195133368&sr=8-1 "Accelerando") by [Charles Stross](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/105-6257023-0214830?%5Fencoding=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Charles%20Stross "Author Charles Stross"). It&#8217;s not my favorite book of his but I really like his work. In this story one of the main characters embodies sort of the ultimate in opensource philosophy. Rather then just the typical &#8220;writing code and giving it away for free&#8221; that we&#8217;re all familiar with, he shares his ideas for free and lives off the goodwill of those who implement them.

It would be an ideal job description for me, and although I never expect to get compensated for an idea I thought I would try to embody that idealism. I seem to recall a website somewhere in the ether with the same philosophy but can&#8217;t recall the URL.

Anyway, in that spirit, here goes;

 **I think someone should hack greasemonkey and google reader so that &#8220;sharing&#8221; or &#8220;starting&#8221; an entry automatically promotes it on digg and reddit. There shouldn&#8217;t be an additional step. Or maybe digg and reddit could simply implement feed slurping for your shared list.**

I believe the future of the Internet as a whole will be an increasingly seemless interaction between multiple services. User&#8217;s don&#8217;t want to manage Gmail and Yahoo mail as separate entities (yes I have both). That&#8217;s a simple example but ask yourself the question why, given the proper security / policy / profile controls, it&#8217;s necessary for you to goto Facebook to receive your Facebook messages.

Why can&#8217;t your Facebook &#8220;status&#8221; be slurped from Twitter, or pushed there?

**Seamless integration, it&#8217;s what many of the best &#8220;hacks&#8221; seem to be about.**

**Lets be witty I&#8217;ll call it &#8220;seemless&#8221; integration, where multiple services seem unified.**
