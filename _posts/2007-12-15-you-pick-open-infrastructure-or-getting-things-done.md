**I’ve been pretty hot on Amazon for a while now. No that’s not a stock tip, rather a statement of my amazement at their success and innovation as a company.**

**If you haven’t realized, Amazon has been branching out beyond being “a bookstore”**, in fact they hate it when people contextualize them as such. You knew they sold [electronics](http://www.amazon.com/electronics "Amazon Electronics") but did you know you can get [groceries](http://lifehacker.com/software/amazon/get-your-groceries-from-amazon-181041.php "Amazon sells Groceries") from them too?<img src="http://blog.thecapacity.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/amazon_subscriptions.png" alt="Amazon subsciptions" align="right" border="1" height="217" hspace="3" vspace="5" width="236" />

An even more strange and interesting curiosity is the fact that that you can “subscribe” to discounted deliveries of toilet paper delivered free with Amazon Prime!

**So it seems like a natural progression… Amazon’s moved from bookseller, to general retailer, to an online super Wall*Mart who can deliver fiber, suggest** ******an appropriate book and** **routinely deliver appropriate accessories for the experience.** ****

However, Amazon’s become more then any of that, much more… **They’ve moved from being an online presence to _enabling_ others, which is a powerful transition because it leverages other business’s success, avoiding the burden of their failures and acts as a [force multiplier](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/force+multiplier "force multiplier") for their revenue!**

First it was [their marketplace,](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/09/23/how-to-use-the-amazon-marketplace-for-fun-and-profit/ "Make money on Amazon Marketplace") which is to [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/ "ebay.com") what [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ "Facebook") is to [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/ "myspace.com"). However, they’ve since moved beyond alternate definitions of ‘retailer’. **Now, in the techno-sphere, Amazon’s best known for their [WebServices](http://www.amazon.com/AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_iw_l_0_3435361_2/104-2683505-7763102?ie=UTF8&node=3435361&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA "Amazon WebServices")** which have been used building all kinds of interesting businesses. They’ve grown so influential in the Web2.0 world, that [James Governor](http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/ "James Governor") at [RedMonk](http://redmonk.com/ "redmonk.com") [suggests IBM should consider purchasing Amazon](http://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2007/04/19/why-ibm-should-acquire-amazon/ "Why IBM should buy Amazon")!

**It would be hard to convince me that Amazon needs IBM.** They’ve been [sponsoring startups](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=377634011 "Amazon Startup Challenge") and recently [put themselves front and center with consumers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000179911 "Amazon and The Tales of Beedle the Bard "), something James believes IBM’s been neglecting

**So currently, it seems no company can compete with the breadth of Amazon’s offerings.** However, [Kevin Burton](http://feedblog.org/ "Kevin Burton's feedblog") and [Nick Carr](http://www.roughtype.com/index.php "Nick Carr's rough type") have been discussing whether or not **Google may soon challenge Amazon’s hosted offerings, aligning itself more fully against Amazon.**

With its search capabilities, Google has long had an leveragable retail presence. First it was passively with [Froogle](http://www.google.com/products "Google Froogle") and then more explicitly with [Google Base](http://www.google.com/base "Google Base") and [Google Checkout](http://checkout.google.com "Google Checkout").

Now the argument centers on whether or not Google will open its compute resources, and **Kevin [asserts](http://feedblog.org/2007/12/14/google-vs-amazon-in-open-infrastructure/) that neither Amazon or the potential Google offering is sufficient. As a ‘techie’ I understand his perspective, which I would insufficiently** **summarize** **as being “vendor lock-in is bad”.** 

**However, having been introduced to the broader business perspectives, I disagree with his conclusion.**

  1. **Historically vendor lock-in hasn’t prohibited adoption when it’s strategically and tactically expedient (e.g. Microsoft, Token-Ring, Intel)**
  2. **I strongly believe OpenSource’s momentum is** **inevitable and** **will destabilize and nullify permenant vendor lock in (e.g. [WINE](http://www.winehq.org "WINE"), the recent opensource implementation of java, and numerous MS Office “import/export” techniques)**
  3. **Technology changes too fast to waste time “not doing” or “reimplementing the wheel”. This is less** **about the latest and greatest gadgets and more** **a statement of business need.**

**There’s a great phrase by](http://radar.oreilly.com/marc "Marc Hedlund") which has stuck with me since I read it; [“Jedi’s build their own lightsabers”](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/jedi_build_thei.html "Jedi's build their own lightsabers")**. Marc leverages this pop culture meme to remind us to never outsource critical for your business components (You must read it!).

**I believe the correlary suggests that any function, fundamental but incidental to your business value should be a candidate for procurement.**

**Even at the risk of “vendor lock in” there’s a list of trade-offs including “time to market” and “cost of competency” to consider.** In Kevin’s ideal world it sounds like we’d all build from scratch and have unlimited time to implement, tweak and benchmark to our heart’s content.

Unfortunately, business necessitates an alternate reality and **if expediency, simplicity and accuracy mean vendor constraint, so be it.**

However, Kevin would be right to point out that **many companies require “flexible on-demand IT” in order to succeed, even if they don’t realize it,** trapped as they are in legacy models and processes.

**When companies talk about outsourcing these components, or letting a vendor’s software product dictate their business & IT processes… I always check to make sure my lightsaber is close.**
