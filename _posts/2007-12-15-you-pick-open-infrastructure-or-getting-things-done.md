**I&#8217;ve been pretty hot on Amazon for a while now. No that&#8217;s not a stock tip, rather a statement of my amazement at their success and innovation as a company.**

**If you haven&#8217;t realized, Amazon has been branching out beyond being &#8220;a bookstore&#8221;**, in fact they hate it when people contextualize them as such. You knew they sold [electronics](http://www.amazon.com/electronics "Amazon Electronics") but did you know you can get [groceries](http://lifehacker.com/software/amazon/get-your-groceries-from-amazon-181041.php "Amazon sells Groceries") from them too?<img src="http://blog.thecapacity.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/amazon_subscriptions.png" alt="Amazon subsciptions" align="right" border="1" height="217" hspace="3" vspace="5" width="236" />

An even more strange and interesting curiosity is the fact that that you can &#8220;subscribe&#8221; to discounted deliveries of toilet paper delivered free with Amazon Prime!

**So it seems like a natural progression&#8230; Amazon&#8217;s moved from bookseller, to general retailer, to an online super Wall*Mart who can deliver fiber, suggest** ******an appropriate book and** **routinely deliver appropriate accessories for the experience.** ****

However, Amazon&#8217;s become more then any of that, much more&#8230; **They&#8217;ve moved from being an online presence to _enabling_ others, which is a powerful transition because it leverages other business&#8217;s success, avoiding the burden of their failures and acts as a [force multiplier](http://www.thefreedictionary.com/force+multiplier "force multiplier") for their revenue!**

First it was [their marketplace,](http://www.getrichslowly.org/blog/2007/09/23/how-to-use-the-amazon-marketplace-for-fun-and-profit/ "Make money on Amazon Marketplace") which is to [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/ "ebay.com") what [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/ "Facebook") is to [MySpace](http://www.myspace.com/ "myspace.com"). However, they&#8217;ve since moved beyond alternate definitions of &#8216;retailer&#8217;. **Now, in the techno-sphere, Amazon&#8217;s best known for their [WebServices](http://www.amazon.com/AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_iw_l_0_3435361_2/104-2683505-7763102?ie=UTF8&node=3435361&no=3435361&me=A36L942TSJ2AJA "Amazon WebServices")** which have been used building all kinds of interesting businesses.

**It would be hard to convince me that Amazon needs IBM.** They&#8217;ve been [sponsoring startups](http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=377634011 "Amazon Startup Challenge") and recently [put themselves front and center with consumers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000179911 "Amazon and The Tales of Beedle the Bard "), something James believes IBM&#8217;s been neglecting

**So currently, it seems no company can compete with the breadth of Amazon&#8217;s offerings.** However, [Kevin Burton](http://feedblog.org/ "Kevin Burton's feedblog") and [Nick Carr](http://www.roughtype.com/index.php "Nick Carr's rough type") have been discussing whether or not **Google may soon challenge Amazon&#8217;s hosted offerings, aligning itself more fully against Amazon.**

With its search capabilities, Google has long had an leveragable retail presence.

Now the argument centers on whether or not Google will open its compute resources, and **Kevin [asserts](http://feedblog.org/2007/12/14/google-vs-amazon-in-open-infrastructure/) that neither Amazon or the potential Google offering is sufficient.

  1. **Historically vendor lock-in hasn&#8217;t prohibited adoption when it&#8217;s strategically and tactically expedient (e.g. Microsoft, Token-Ring, Intel)**
  2. **I strongly believe OpenSource&#8217;s momentum is** **inevitable and** **will destabilize and nullify permenant vendor lock in (e.g. [WINE](http://www.winehq.org "WINE"), the recent opensource implementation of java, and numerous MS Office &#8220;import/export&#8221; techniques)**
  3. **Technology changes too fast to waste time &#8220;not doing&#8221; or &#8220;reimplementing the wheel&#8221;. This is less** **about the latest and greatest gadgets and more** **a statement of business need.**

**There&#8217;s a great phrase by](http://radar.oreilly.com/marc "Marc Hedlund") which has stuck with me since I read it; [&#8220;Jedi&#8217;s build their own lightsabers&#8221;](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/jedi_build_thei.html "Jedi's build their own lightsabers")**. Marc leverages this pop culture meme to remind us to never outsource critical for your business components (You must read it!).

**I believe the correlary suggests that any function, fundamental but incidental to your business value should be a candidate for procurement.**

**Even at the risk of &#8220;vendor lock in&#8221; there&#8217;s a list of trade-offs including &#8220;time to market&#8221; and &#8220;cost of competency&#8221; to consider.** In Kevin&#8217;s ideal world it sounds like we&#8217;d all build from scratch and have unlimited time to implement, tweak and benchmark to our heart&#8217;s content.

Unfortunately, business necessitates an alternate reality and **if expediency, simplicity and accuracy mean vendor constraint, so be it.**

However, Kevin would be right to point out that **many companies require &#8220;flexible on-demand IT&#8221; in order to succeed, even if they don&#8217;t realize it,** trapped as they are in legacy models and processes.

**When companies talk about outsourcing these components, or letting a vendor&#8217;s software product dictate their business & IT processes&#8230; I always check to make sure my lightsaber is close.**
