You can probably tell from the picture that my wife and I have done a lot of traveling. I actually finished [Superclass](http://www.amazon.com/Superclass-Global-Power-Elite-Making/dp/0374272107/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223819547&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20) a few weeks ago. Yet, I&#8217;m embarrassed to admit it&#8217;s been over a month since I [proclaimed](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2008/09/07/booklist-entry-1/) my intent to review the books I&#8217;ve been reading.

However, I&#8217;m determined not to interleave reviews so let me comment on this one so I can get on with the others! In fact, I&#8217;m quite certain I can review this in far less time then it took me to complete.

**I really respect the tone with which David Rothkopf approached his topic. Writing rationally about a global elite which could move mountains, especially in this day and age, is a tough line to walk.** 

**I also think David gives well weighted credibility to debunking the &#8220;conspiracy theories&#8221; as well as highlighting the dangers that such a connected class brings whether intentionally or accidentally.**

**Despite his even handed approach I wish I could have found the technique as enjoyable.** I&#8217;m not someone who enjoys &#8220;the name game&#8221; or following cliques and lists of &#8220;who&#8217;s who&#8221; and **perhaps that made this book extra tough for me.**

**The first and last few chapters are pretty enjoyable but the meat of the book is was very difficult** for me to make it through. I&#8217;d recommend the book to anyone who&#8217;s interested in this topic but **it&#8217;s a perfect example of the benefits of your local library!**
