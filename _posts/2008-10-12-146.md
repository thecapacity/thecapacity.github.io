You can probably tell from the picture that my wife and I have done a lot of traveling. I actually finished [Superclass](http://www.amazon.com/Superclass-Global-Power-Elite-Making/dp/0374272107/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1223819547&sr=8-1&tag=thecapacity-20) a few weeks ago. Yet, I’m embarrassed to admit it’s been over a month since I [proclaimed](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2008/09/07/booklist-entry-1/) my intent to review the books I’ve been reading.

However, I’m determined not to interleave reviews so let me comment on this one so I can get on with the others! In fact, I’m quite certain I can review this in far less time then it took me to complete.

**I really respect the tone with which David Rothkopf approached his topic. Writing rationally about a global elite which could move mountains, especially in this day and age, is a tough line to walk.** 

**I also think David gives well weighted credibility to debunking the “conspiracy theories” as well as highlighting the dangers that such a connected class brings whether intentionally or accidentally.**

**Despite his even handed approach I wish I could have found the technique as enjoyable.** I’m not someone who enjoys “the name game” or following cliques and lists of “who’s who” and **perhaps that made this book extra tough for me.**

**The first and last few chapters are pretty enjoyable but the meat of the book is was very difficult** for me to make it through. I’d recommend the book to anyone who’s interested in this topic but **it’s a perfect example of the benefits of your local library!**
