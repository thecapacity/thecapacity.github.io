Seth Godin is one of the present day kings of the blogosphere, and for good reason. He has the cutting insight of a &#8220;techie&#8221; but his presence and assessments bespeak someone with marketing talent.

So his [latest post](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/10/what-youre-up-1.html "Seth Godin - What you're up against") raises more then a few concerns for me. **Is it true that we&#8217;re all up against someone with so much passion (and seemingly more then a little time to spare) that we can&#8217;t possibly hold our own ?** While Seth&#8217;s post isn&#8217;t quite that negative, I have a tenancy to abstract out more then a few steps (more on that in another post), it&#8217;s really my assessment of his point that causes alarm.

In sports we&#8217;re used to the idea that **someone out there is &#8220;bigger, faster, stronger&#8221;**. It&#8217;s something most of us take as a given, almost a requirement, given the prevailing passion the underdog inspires as well.

Yet in sports we know &#8220;anyone can be beat on any given day&#8221; and that the contest is a singular struggle of a finite duration (even with the many days of cricket). However, the digital world has shifted those economies of scale, now one can combat many and even if they&#8217;re &#8220;beaten&#8221; on one post, the sheer volume of &#8220;playoffs&#8221; suggest they&#8217;d trounce you over time. **So does this mean we&#8217;re reduced to &#8220;one [view] to rule them all&#8221; or even just a pool of enthusiasts while the rest who &#8220;can&#8217;t compete&#8221; are left to watch from the sidelines ?**

**I think not**, although it may just be delirium and bias. Open media, and blogs in general have already proven that **&#8220;everyone can compete&#8221;**, so to continue the sports analogy we know **there&#8217;s no coach to take you out**. Yet no one wants to rage against the unresponsive ether, so we must decide if there&#8217;s value in &#8220;less enthusiastic&#8221; participation ?

Given the popularity of knock-off handbags, we know that not everyone requires &#8220;perfect spirit&#8221; to pervade a product, in fact in today&#8217;s economy people are more then likely to buy a $50 drill then one that&#8217;s $200, regardless of how long either one lasts.

But beyond shadowy discussions of &#8220;valuations&#8221;, &#8220;opportunity costs&#8221; and intellectual property disputes, which seem to imply a &#8220;parasitic value&#8221;, **I contend that &#8220;less enthusiastic&#8221; people provide value that enthusiasts can not**.

The nature of enthusiasts suggests determination and focus, while &#8220;generalists&#8221; may have opportunities to provide &#8220;bigger picture&#8221; views, which does not imply lower value. **It is hard to overlook an enthusiasts&#8217; myopic tenancies, leaving those less dedicated the opportunity to innovate.**

Seth&#8217;s correct in implying that **you must have passion to succeed**, and attention to detail is important too. **However, it doesn&#8217;t mean you have to harvest your own charcoal, simply [build your own lightsabers](http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/jedi_build_thei.html "Build your own lightsabers").**
