In the beginning you were a Starfighter, recruited by the Star League to defend the Frontier against Xur and the Ko-Dan armada… well, actually the beginning was something much simpler, something more like  [Space Invaders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders).

Space Invaders was a classic, it spurred the video game industry, inspired a vast genre, can still be played [online](http://www.freespaceinvaders.org/) and occasionally even [in a lecture hall](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VczbbiRmDik).

Now, you can play in my office;

Well, it would be hubris to claim that my [humble beginnings](http://hackaday.com/2009/01/14/wiimote-controlled-coil-gun/) have reached the same success but I do believe it has matured in much the same vein. I seem to have moved beyond building a [deadly office putting toy](http://www.engadget.com/2009/01/15/wiimote-pens-coffee-cup-office-putting-toy-deadly-coil-g/) to a serious [office defense](http://i.gizmodo.com/5131968/wiimote+controlled-coil-gun-gets-serious-about-office-warfare) system!

This might even classify as something much more sophisticated than some [Russian spy gear](http://www.crunchgear.com/2009/01/15/wiimote-controlled-coil-gun/)! Now I’m truly ready to defend my office against any and all invaders, alien or otherwise!

In truth, I’m hoping I can stash this in a friends office maybe for a surprise ambush! However, in practice it might be hard to convince someone to put on a face shield before heading to work.

Building from [my previous creation](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2009/01/13/wiimote-controlled-coil-gun/) I connected my wiimote to a servo via some python and my [ioBridge](http://iobridge.com/) [204 module](http://iobridge.com/store/), only this time I replaced the coilgun with a remotely triggered airsoft gun! Now there are no more issues with reloading a weapons system half a world a way after each shot!
