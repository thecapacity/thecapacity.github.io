I&#8217;d like to take this brief interlude to make a painful admission to you. You may be asking how one could have a &#8220;.5&#8221; book review&#8230; Well, I opened a book but actually didn&#8217;t read it!

In my youth, such a situation was cause for major turmoil, but thankfully as I&#8217;ve gotten older it&#8217;s become easier for me to admit something is a &#8220;waste&#8221; of my time and to move on without needing to turn that final page for true closure.

However, I&#8217;m still loath to perform such an action as I&#8217;m one who believes in &#8220;expanding your knowledge horizons&#8221; and I often feel aversion is a sign of successfully encountering such a stretching perspective.

Yet, in this case things were different. I won&#8217;t bore you with the positive comments on **[Habits of the High-Tech Heart: Living Virtuously in the Information Age](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0801027810/ref=ord_cart_shr?%5Fencoding=UTF8&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&v=glance&tag=thecapacity-20)** since there&#8217;s plenty on Amazon to draw you to it. But I will say I&#8217;d managed to put this book out of my mind until I was cleaning out my Amazon list in preparation for the holidays.

What I did admit is that I checked this book out, read the introduction, and promptly gave up in disgust and if you&#8217;re at all intrigued by the reviews then I&#8217;d encourage you to try the intro at a local library before purchasing.

This is a book intended to remind us all to &#8220;cut free&#8221; on occasion and the review says the author &#8220;does not advocate the eradication&#8221; of technology.

However, what I found in the first pages was an obvious perspective that although technology is here to say and has many emotional benefits that the only rewarding path is to short circuit its use and circumvent it entirity.

It may be that the bulk of the book is more even keeled or I mistakenly judged too harshly, but I decided that I&#8217;m well enough versed on the perils of our technological landscape.

I do practice cutting free and try to remember to experience events and not simply record them. However, I think it speaks of false hope and misconstrued expectation to believe you can only find goodness outside of, or without. technology.

I&#8217;d love to hear about your experience with this book if anyone manages to give it a go but it certainly won&#8217;t be one I&#8217;d recommend putting on your holiday wish list.
