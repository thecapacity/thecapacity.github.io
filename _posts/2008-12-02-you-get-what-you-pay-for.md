If you read this post on the site as opposed to via RSS you may have noticed the Theme change (and now be wondering why I changed it back).

The trial them was [ASCII-one](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/12/02/ascii-one-a-free-wordpress-theme/) and other then not being able to figure out how to remove some of my sidebar contents I thought it was spectacular.

However, a friend informed me that he was unable to post a comment and I can only ascribe this to the update (or truthfully it could have been the migration to WordPress 2.7-RC1).

So I thought I&#8217;d switch back to the old one for now and test things out and give things time to bake.

I know most of you don&#8217;t post comments here anyway so it likely doesn&#8217;t matter. I actual prefer it that way believe it or not. Well I don&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t like the feedback and input but I get most of it via twitter and that&#8217;s just fine with me.

Personally I&#8217;d love it if WP just allowed pingbacks and no comments except via twitter. I mean that every post page should have a list of the times it was twittered and / or posted.

I just don&#8217;t think every WP should have to maintain it&#8217;s own user authentication system, and judging by the constant &#8220;new user registrations&#8221; which look like spammers to me, I&#8217;d be happy not to.
