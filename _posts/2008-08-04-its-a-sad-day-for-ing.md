**I’ve been using ING for quite some time now and have always enjoyed them.** Easy to open accounts, prompt service, people on the other end of the phone and nearly nonexistant hold times have **always made them a great company to do business with**. Oh, and semi-decent rates aren’t bad either.

**Of course I suppose it can’t all be sunflowers and daffodils…**

I was born a southern boy, and although you can take the boy out of the south, you can’t take the south out of the boy. **Like so many other Southerners I know, I have three names**… first, middle and last. That may not sound all that astounding to those of you who also have three names, but I’ve noticed southerners seem committed to utilize as many boxes as possible when filling in our names for standardized tests.

It’s not actually length which seems to set our measure (as opposed to so many other contests) but rather **a particular pride in actually utilizing those names in daily life.** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">How many of you know your friend’s middle names or rarely use your own?</span>

**I typically go by my middle name although I’m actually quite proud of all my names.** My middle name is shorter, more personal and less prone than my first to being butchered by people who don’t know me well enough to be beyond such liberties.

**I go by**;

  * First Middle Last (official documents like my passport),
  * First Last sometimes including First M. Last (random semi-official stuff which tend to believe you really only need the two)
  * Middle Last (more personal but no less official relationships)

It’s never caused problems, perhaps a few misrouted professional emails, but certainly in my personal life the fact that all three representations are for a single individual have never encited more then a few friendly conversations about how I like to be addressed.

**Of course until now…** <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Apparently ING is unable to accept checks for deposit that are made out to anything but the full name on the account.</span>

I can’t tell how how mad and frustrated I am about this stupid constraint. I actually called back a second time to confirm with a manager. I understand it’s not sny particular individual’s fault but all rational I received were simplistic justifications to ignore something that by the manager’s admission it “happens on a number of occasions”.

Even when my wife changed her last name our local bank was able to accept checks with an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">entirely different last name</span>. However, even though I have all the names on my account ING felt like they weren’t able to make this concession because “they didn’t know me” … as though my local teller could pick me out of a lineup!

**After more then a few decades of being myself it’s not the first time I’ve had to tell a company they will be losing my business, though this is the first time my name has been the reason.**

<span style="text-decoration: underline;">However, this is one of the first time’s I’ve meant such a statement with such sadness.</span>
