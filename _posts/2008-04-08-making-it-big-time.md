_Every athlete dreams of two things&#8230; (1) making it to &#8220;the big dance&#8221; and (2) having that magical moment forever immortalized&#8230; with an advertising contract._

Admit it, it&#8217;s true. Tiger has [his own Gatorade](http://gatorade.com/gatoradetiger/ "Tiger Gatorade") now and Anna Kournikova, who apparently needs no subtitle (watch the commercial) is back in a K-Swiss campaign (which I won&#8217;t dignify with a link).

Well now it&#8217;s my turn! OK, so _I admit it&#8217;s not some multi-billion dollar contract_&#8230; actually it&#8217;s just one post. _But it&#8217;s beyond the trite look of striped shoes, or the bitter taste of electrolytes &#8230; it&#8217;s coffee!_

I&#8217;d stumbled across a coffee &#8220;[beta test](http://beta.joffreys.com/ "Joffrey's Beta Test")&#8221; sponsored by [Joffrey&#8217;s](http://joffreys.com/) and decided that if Amazon had my home address what&#8217;s the harm of one more company? _The deal was they&#8217;d sent you a packet of &#8220;Jamaican Me Crazy&#8221; in return for a tasting and a post._

Now for those of you who may not know, _I have a bit of a sordid history with the magic bean. My wife was a Starbucks barista (and Coffee Master) for more than two years, so I have a bit of an honorary coffee master&#8217;s &#8220;black apron&#8221; myself. Hot chocolates with a shot of espresso were my gateway but now I drink Americanos, black._

I still frequent the local &#8216;Bux from time to time, to get my daily dose and flirt with the Barristas (for old times sake, I promise). I have my own collection of coffee making implements now; from a thermal insulated 12 cup Capresso drip to a stove-top perk-pot for special occasions.

However, _my absolute favorite is my &#8220;[Aeropress](http://www.aerobie.com/Products/aeropress_story.htm "Aeropress")&#8221; which I use daily and am still required to explain that it&#8217;s not tea._

_If you&#8217;re visual and want some photos for the narrative then check out [my tumblr page](http://wjhuie.tumblr.com/ "wjhuie tumblr photos") for photos._

I got my package in the mail and was excited to take it to work the next day. I&#8217;d idly dreamed of trying the roast in each of my brewing devices and holding coffee tastings, with chocolate, raspberries and lemon biscotte. However, the package contained about 4 &#8211; 2oz scoops (in my world that&#8217;s enough for 2 cups of coffee) so I decided to just use the Aeropress which is ideal for smaller batches.

_When you open the packet, the smell hits you like a spring day after a hard rain. To me, it was buckwheat pancakes with a hint of maple syrup. Not a heavily sweetened by any means just that organic nuttiness with an ephemeral touch of grandma&#8217;s caramel apples._ The grounds actually looked like they had some dehydrated crystals, but a quick test disproved that assumption (yes I did eat them). I could have left the bag open on my desk for a week and considered it a successful sponsorship.

Yet there was tasting to be done and java calling, so I loaded up my Aero and made the brew!

The first thing I noticed was the lack of oils. Oily behavior is highlighted in most &#8216;Bux blends and contributes to their &#8220;robust&#8221; profiles. And _initially I did feel the overall blend lacked the &#8220;robusto&#8221; of what I was used to drinking, as thought it had a sweet start and a nutty finish but lacked in the middle. The flavoring is not strong to taste but has an aromatic quality that leaves a solid impression._

However, each sip had a consistent flavor even as it cooled and I decided to fine tune my second brew.

_Working with a new coffee is a little tricky and I believe I made two mistakes._ The first is that I was in such a hurry to taste test (and get to my meeting) that I neglected to let the grounds steep for ~30 seconds (can you sense the anticipation). Secondly, I put about 2 oz too much of hot water in my cup (a trusty metal camping mug).

I actually saved the packet for the next day (I&#8217;ve been trying to cut back&#8230; honest&#8230;) and simply folded the top over until morning. When I got to my desk the first thing I did was smell the grounds, what a way to start your day!

I could tell they had lost just a bit of their initial aroma but _it really let me smell the quality of the beans beneath._

Back to the kitchenette I counted a full 35 seconds before I started pressing, and did a 3:1 ratio of hot water to concentrate (as opposed to 4:1). This time, the lack of oils was still visible but I could tell I&#8217;d hit a sweeter brew because of the &#8220;thicker&#8221; coloring of the distilled coffee as it poured.

_This second cup was actually really fantastic, as the additional steep time had given it the chance to round out the body of the brew. I also think the overnight aeration had allowed the flavoring a chance to level off and permit the beans their chance to shine._

So how was my moment of glory? Well first let me say I&#8217;m not a flavored coffee person and forgo milk and sugar too. Thus the overall brew wasn&#8217;t my particular pleasure but _I know a lot of people who &#8220;Dr.&#8221; their coffee and would have loved it. It was a really smooth cup of coffee that most people search for._

Although I was surprised at the lack of oils, _the quality of the beans will definitely get me to investigate Joffrey&#8217;s other roasts_. Now that my wife&#8217;s not at &#8216;Bux anymore we&#8217;ve tried a lot of alternate roasts including Green Mountain, Pete&#8217;s, and even Dunkin Donuts which would previously have been sacrilege (and now that I&#8217;ve tried it has been excommunicated indefinitely).

_Don&#8217;t just take my word for it though, check our their beta test and see if you can get a packet of your own!_
