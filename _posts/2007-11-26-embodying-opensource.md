Just the other day [I wrote](http://blog.thecapacity.org/?p=21 "Step by Step") how **I hope the &#8220;opensource&#8221; culture, not of technology but of social obligation, will begin to evolve the enterprise.**

I&#8217;ve been working through a serious backlog of articles, and while [this one&#8217;s](http://www.testearly.com/2007/08/17/fire-your-best-peoplereward-the-lazy-ones/ "Fire the lazy ones") been on my &#8220;to read&#8221; list for a while it was particular relevant to my last post.

The title &#8220;Fire your best people, reward the lazy ones&#8221; is inflammatory but **the article itself accurately represents one way that opensource culture beats out the traditional enterprise behavior.**

> &#8220;To me, <u>if the knowledge is locked in your head, you are a _less_ valuable, not more valuable, resource</u>.&#8221;

I know &#8220;traditionally&#8221; such knowledge lock-in was considered &#8220;job security&#8221; but it&#8217;s an attitude I find unfathomable. Perhaps if you enjoy being stuck forever in your current job, however **such an isolationist tendency will quickly leave your code and skills outdated and ripe for replacement.**

**So ask yourself, How have you emabled someone today?**
