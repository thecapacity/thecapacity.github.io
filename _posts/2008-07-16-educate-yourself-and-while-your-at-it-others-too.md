As I [wrote yesterday](http://blog.thecapacity.org/2008/07/15/can-we-break-the-generation-gap-in-business/) **I love TED Talks**… oh yea and I did also mention a growing sense of disenfranchisement.

**I try not to take the information I gather for granted**, and one of the joys I experience is in sharing with others. Of course, **I am aware that sometimes it can be overwhelming and I try to limit the deluge**. I feel I can filter for friends because I know them so well and I hope that they realize that often, I simply want them to know something “exists” even if they don’t need to know “about” it in depth. That is to say; **sometimes reading headlines is enough.**

I don’t I believe I’m the single source of information, nor would I really want that for people. **The second greatest joy is when people in turn filter for me**. It represents both a dialog as well as a foil to view other people’s perceptions. **I also hold as fact that anyone worth knowing doesn’t leave their education in the hands of others.**

**People with a natural curiosity and the intellect to satiate that appetite are an amazing combination.** So go forth and learn, but for a moment **allow me to direct your attention.**

TED recently released their [Top 10 TED Talks](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/top10) although I would have probably chosen a different segment, **I assume people will check out the list in their leisure time**, but I realize not everyone has the same time frames that I do.**

**T****here’s [one video](http://youtube.com/watch?v=iG9CE55wbtY) which combines the flavor of yesterday’s commentary with the sense of “information obligation” (both to search and to share) that I hope each of you embodies.**

In **“_Do schools today kill creativity?_”** Ken Robinson presents wonderfully and **suggests that the education principals of today won’t serve the needs of the future.**

Arguing over the word “killing” can result in semantic discussions of “intent” and many negative connotations so **I think it’s important to suggest a premise that the creative needs of society change over time.**

So whether malicious or not, in business and society, **implications are that we can not rely on the exact same set of traits over time.**

There are still some whether; ethics & integrity, curiosity & problem solving, which are “oldies but goodies” and are foundational, but **in today’s age, you must commit to learn and practice your skills new and old with the help of other individuals, for none can do it all alone.**
